      <description>Are you a Cyber Sec student? Or just interested in the Cyber Sec space?
Yes, and yes!
Do you go to family and friends, hop on their network and poke around? It’s easy to do and you can quickly find vulnerabilities that someone could exploit.
Recently, I stayed at my wife’s uncle and aunties house and I noticed a major network vuln.
Imagine you put a lock on a door for home security but never lock it, robbers just come in every night to look around.</description>

      <title>Homelabs 2023 Beginner&#39;s Guide To Homelabbing</title>

      <guid>/homelab/</guid>
      <description>You are probably new to homelabbing and need a bit of guidance. Building a homelab means building a computer network, or lab, at home.
Homelabs can be anything from old laptops to expensive high-end enterprise equipment.
Typically, you’ll find homelabs involve a lot of virtual computers, meaning they’re not physical. There’s little entry to get started and unlimited possibility as your homelab grows.
You’ll find techies and sys-admins from all over the world who love to share their homelabs, projects and builds.</description>

      <description>Homelabs are fun, challenging, but fun.
Building an entire virtual network of interconnected computers to simulate real-world traffic and situations.
This is my additional guide to Cyberwox’s Building a Cybersecurity Homelab, but, for those using VirtualBox. Here’s a visual guide for the lab:
*Disclaimer, this does not contain 100% of the steps of this project.
Intro Ideally, use a dedicated lab computer for this, a spare laptop or an old gaming PC.</description>
