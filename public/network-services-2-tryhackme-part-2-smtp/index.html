Start\nmachine so we can get our VM up andrunning and we’ll go over to task five.\nUnderstanding SMTP and wecan just go on here.\nWhat is it?\nSo it stands for Simple Mail Transfer\nprotocol is utilized to handlethe sending of emails.\nSo you probably use this protocolbefore whether you knew it or not.\nAnd in order for this to work,\nthere are a pair of support emailservices compromising of Pop and IMAP.\nTogether they allow the user to send\noutgoing mail and retrieveincoming mail respectively.\nSo, SMTP server performsthree basic functions.\nSo it Verifies who is sendingthe emails through the SMTP server.\nIt sends the outgoing mail and if\nthe outgoing mail can’t be delivered,it sends the message back to the sender.\nCool.\nSo most people will have encountered SNCPwhen configuring a new email address\non some third party emailclients such as Thunderbird.\nI’ve had done this like setting upfor friends or family or for work purposes\nand as when you configurea new email client.\nCool.So Pop and IMAP.\nSo Post Office Protocol and thenInternet Message Access Protocol.\nSo they’re both email protocols who are\nresponsible for transfer of emailsbetween client and a mail server.\nThe main difference is Pop’s moresimplistic approach of downloading\nthe inbox from the mail serverto the client, where IMAP will synchronize\nthe current inbox with the newmail on the server.\nThose two options are sort of like\nthe implementation of IMAP personallyand downloading anything new.\nSo this means that changes to the inboxmade on the computer over IMAP will assist\nif you synchronize and then synchronizethe inbox from other computer.\nPopper imapse is responsiblefor fulfilling this process.\nSo how does it work?\nWe have a little diagram here.\nEmail delivery functions much the sameway as physical email delivery system.\nUser will supply the email\na letter and service the postal deliveryservice and through a series of steps\nwe’ll deliver it to the recipient’sinbox or post box.\nSo the role of the SMTP server in thisservice is to act as the sorting office.\nSo the email is picked up and sent\nto the server, which thendirects it to the recipient.\nWe can map the journey of an email\nfrom computer looking likethis user to the server.\nSMTP server going out, pinging around,\ngoing to the i, map or Pop serverand then going to the recipient.\nSo it lists out the order.\nGoing to just skip past this for now.\nAnd there’s a good article here,which another article is on my read list.\nWhat runs SMTP software is readilyavailable on Windows Server platforms,\nwith many other variantsbeing available on links.\nWindows Server,\nthey’ve got email client Bob server justbuilt into it if you activate it,\nmore information if you want technicaldevice implementation of it, go like that.\nCool.\nAll right, let’s go overthe questions together.\nAnd we’ve got what does SMTP stand for?So we had it up here.\nWe’ve got simple mail transferprotocol so we can pop that in.\nWhat does Smt handle?\nThe sending of so what does ithelp or what does it actually send?\nEmails.Yeah.\n39, baby.\nWhat is the first step in the Smt process?That’s what I skipped.\nSo let’s go back here.\nSo we’ve got the mail user agent,which is either your email client or\nexternal program, connectsto the server of your name.\nSo connects or something.\nSo we wantthe mail user agent connects to the SMTP\nservice domain,initiates the SMTP handshake.\nThat’s what we’re looking for.\nSo it connects, but it authenticates.\nThis connection works over SMTP port,which is usually 25.\nSo looking for the SMTP handshakeand what is the default port?\n25.That’s the well known port.\nSomething that’s good to memorize,I definitely have.\nWhere does SMTP service send the email?\nIf the recipient service is not available,it can’t be accessed.\nUnavailable email gets put into the SMTP\nif it can’t reach it.\nIf the recipient server can’t be accessed\nor is not available,the email gets put into an smtpq.\nOkay, not exactly back to the sender on.\nWhat server does the emailultimately end up on?\nSo it’s either pop or IMAP.\nSo we can use that diagram,\nultimately ends up here and thenconnects or gets sent to the recipient.\nBut ultimately it’son the server, I guess.\nCan a Linux machine run an SMTP server?\nYeah, pretty sure everything can.A Windows?\nWell, yeah, it’s sammy builtinto the system once you turn it on.\nSo yeah.Cool.\nAwesome.\nAll right, we are up to the next one,is going to ping our IP.\nSo we’re going to go on to task six,enumerating SMTP.\nSo we’ll probably start with another port\nscan against the targetmachine and we’ll see.\nSo we’ll do what we’ve beendoing and we’ll run Nmap now.\nAnd then we’ll go through.\nSo I found that this\nstring or string this set of switchesfor the Nmap command,\nrunning A and running T four speeds upthe process and doing all the ports.\nThis has been working quite well.\nI still am skeptical of the T four\nspeeding it up, but sofar things going well.\nSo we’re going to run that.\nAnd as that’s running in the background,I can see 25 already.\nSo I know that’s defaultfrom the last task.\nSo that’s cool.That’s the default SMTP.\nOkay, so let’s get started.\nBefore we begin, make sure to deploythe room check and enrolling service.\nPoorly configured or vulnerable mail\nservers can often provide initialfootholds into our network.\nBut prior to launching intact,we want to fingerprint the server.\nFingerprint the server to make ourtargeting as precise as possible.\nIs that sort of this term, fingerprinting?\nIs that sort of just like\na way of when you’ve got you’reenumerating,\nyou’re getting like a fingerprint,something unique to identify servers.\nThat’s sort of what that means.\nNot sure, but it sounds cool.\nWe’re going to use the SMTPversion module in Metasploit.\nMetasploit is an awesomeframework that can do a lot.\nThere’s a couple of rooms and try Hack Mejust dedicated to learning this tool.\nSo it’s good to go over this to keeplearning it because it’s massive.\nSo there’s a set of modules builtaround enumerating or exploiting SMTP.\nSo that’s cool.\nAs its name implies,it will scan a range of IP addresses\nand determine the version of anymail servers it encounters.\nCool.\nEnumerating users from SMTP.\nSo the SMTP services has two internalcommands that allow the enumeration\nof users vrrfy,confirming the names of valid users,\nand X-E-X-P-N which reveals the actualaddress of users aliases, endless email.\nThat’s kind of cool that we can pull\nthat out without going on to itor accessing it.\nUsing the SMTP commands,we can reveal a list of valid users.\nOkay, we can do this manuallyover a telnet connection.\nHowever, Metasploit comes into the rescue,writing a handy module appropriately\ncalled SMTP enum for enumerationthat will do the legwork for us.\nUsing the module is a simple matterof feeding it a host or range of hosts\nto scan with a wordlist containingusernames to enumerate.\nSo we mighthave some usernames given to us or we\nmight have to use just a randomword list of generic usernames.\nWe’ll see what instructions give us,\nbut we’ve definitely got ourhost that we can plug into it.\nSo your requirements as we’re going to be\nusing Metasploit for this, it’s importantthat you have Metasploit installed.\nIt is by default.\nSo if you need it, you can go Apt install.\nI think it’s MSF console or Metasploit.\nIt might probably tell us,but it’s one of those.\nBut yeah, we should probably do an Apt\nupdate and upgradeand do that in the background.\nOkay, so we’re all good.\nWe can do Apt order remove,get rid of some old packages.\nCool.Okay.\nIt’s worth noting that you’re checking\nwill work for the majorityof SMCP configurations.\nHowever, there are other non metasploittools such as SMCP User enum that work\neven better for enumerating OS level useraccounts on solaris bias, and CV service.\nEnumeration is performedby inspecting the responses.\nAll these different sowhat were these again?\nThese were SMCP services.\nSo it tries to get responses from these.Okay.\nSort of understanding it.\nThe technique could be adapted in future\nto work against othervulnerable SMCP diamonds.\nBut this hasn’t been doneat the time of writing.\nIt’s an alternative that’s worthkeeping in mind preparation.\nOkay, cool.\nSo let’s run a port scanagainst the target machine.\nSame as last time.What port is SMTP running on?\nSo my port scan is still goingand it’s going to go for a while.\nSo let’s try and see if we canjust answer these as it’s running.\nOkay, so it’s definitely on 25,\nand that’s based on this firstport that’s the scan has told.\nAnd if your skin isn’t showing anything,make sure you use your VB for talkative.\nThat’s going to see all this informationabout what our scans actually doing.\nOkay, now we know what port we should betargeting, let’s start up metasploit.\nWhat command do we use?\nSo I’m just going to go and open a new\nterminal here and just letthat run in the background.\nI’m just going to go over to our system.\nSo we’ve got our scan happening at themoment, so we’ll just let that run.\nSo for this we use MSF console.\nSo we should have MSF console.\nAnd let’s search the module SMTPso we can use Q to enter quietly.\nSo usually you get a big oldbanner message, which is fine.\nYou can just run MSF consoleand just open it up.\nJust Q can take a little while.\nI might need to run MSF console and knit\nor Msfdb and it but looks like we’reworking so we can search for Smt.\nSMTP underscore version.\nSo here we’ve got.\nSet as ID zero.\nSo this is like our search results.\nAnd if there were other things thatmatched this, we would get a big list.\n012-3456 seven.\nSo this is just set to zero isthe first one that’s come back.\nCool.So this is probably what we’re after.\nSo what’s the full module name?\nWe got it now.Great.\nNow select the module in the list.\nHow do we do this?\nIt tells us here.\nSo we can go info zero if we wantto find out more information.\nOr we can just go use zero.\nSo we can just go use zero,but it’s not looking for that.\nDon’t know.I’m going to come back to that one.\nHave a look through the options.\nDoes everything seem correct?\nWhat is the option we need to set?\nSo we definitely need to set.\nOkay, we’ll look it up.\nSo we’ve just used zero.\nSo that selected our tool.\nThis is going to be the tool orthe module that we’re using.\nAnd we need to set it up.\nWe can’t just set up so we can usenot get was it set?\nYeah.\nSo if we look at set, we can maybe\nknow the differencebetween certain options.\nBut if we just type in options,we’ve got Rhosts, R port and threads.\nOkay, so all three of thesethings are required.\nWe can see here the port that we’respecifying is already set to default 25.\nBecause that’s the defaultof SMTP, I assume.\nSo cool.\nBut then the rhost.\nSo this is the actual host or the IP orthe machine that we’re wanting to target.\nSo we can go set Rhosts to and justpaste in our IP address like that.\nThat confirms with ourhost is equal to that.\nSo if you just want to confirm that,you can type in your options again.\nAnd now we can see that.Indeed.\nWe’ve got it there.Awesome.\nSo the last step of our thing,we can just hit run, but.\nLet’S.Just finish this off.\nSo we got our host.\nI honestly do not know what that is.\nSet the correct value of your targetmachine, then run the exploit.\nWhat’s the system mail name?\nSo we can just run run orwe can just run exploit.\nThese all sort of just work that willtarget the system with this payload.\nOkay, so we’ve got SMTP polo, SMTP home.\nSo it looks like that’s the systemmail name that we’re looking for.\nSo what was our hand?Looks roughly like an email address.\nSort of what mail transferagent MCA is running.\nSo if we have a look, this could post fix.\nMight be our mail agent.That’s our mail agent.\nIf you need to send a letter, you post it.\nSo that was the hint where you post fix.\nThat’s the mail transfer agent MCA.\nNot exactly sure what that is.\nI don’t remember that showing up.\nI may have skipped over.\nThat another one.\nTo lock that in.\nOkay, good.\nNow you’ve got a good amount\nof information on the targetto move on to the next stage.\nLet’s search for the SMTP enumso we don’t have to exit or go back.\nWe can just use searchhere and we can find it.\nSo again, we can just go use zero because\non the list it’s the first oneand computers start at zero.\nSo we’re going to go use zero.\nAnd we can see here ourprompt has actually changed.\nSo we no longer selected this.\nWe’ve now selected SMTP.\nSo that’s just asking,what’s the full name?\nThis is good.\nThis is making sure that we’re actuallyusing the right tool like this.\nWe’re going to be usingthe top usernames shortlist.\nNo.Is my scan still going yet?\nI actually don’t know what this is.\nLet me just open up.\nI’m going to have to download it.\nI don’t have it.\nI’ve seen a couple of people use this\nlocate commands to try and find any filelike that, but I don’t have it by default.\nSo we’ll have to download it.\nSo it’s amazing collection of Wordlist.\nIf you’re running Carly Parrot,install Seclists.\nOkay.\nIt’s a part of Seclist,so we can just go apt install seclists\nand that’ll grab that for usand then we should have it.\nCool.\nI am going to try that locate tool againonce this downloads,\njust to see what options do weneed to set in the Word lists.\nSo if we go options again,we’ve got our host.\nSo we need to set ourhost and then use a file.\nSo this is going to be our Wordlist.\nSo we can see here by default.\nWe’ve got Unix usernamesset, so that’s cool.\nIf we just ran this, we may have a chance.\nSo I’m just going to look up thisand see if I can okay, so this is it.\nThis is the raw list.\nSo not that big of a list at all.\nI’m fairly confident if I just use thatother default list that it would work.\nWhat I’m going to do is I’m just going toget this right here.\nI’ve got to go back here and we’regoing to set the user file to this.\nAnd now I know the file there and I’mgoing to run it and hopefully see\nsomething different because weactually have fed a wordlist into it.\nSo since it’s not that long,it shouldn’t take that long.\nSo it’s under usernames.\nWas there a usernames?\nMan, I’m so blind.\nI didn’t even see that.\nOkay, can we just list outwhat’s in the usernames?\nAnd there it is.\nOkay, I swear I do this.\nI just find the longest way to do things.\nAnyway.\nWe have got it working.\nEven if I do things the wrong way,I’m going to pause the video.\nNo, I’m not.Here we are.\nI will pause the video to figureout what the hell that question is.\nBut we have foundadministrator has worked.\nSo that’s cool.And my skin finished.\nI’m just going to cap thisout and grab three open.\nSo still only two ports open.\nGood that we did the whole scan justin case there was something else.\nSo what was it?\nAdministrator?\nI’m so dumb.\nI just wasn’t understanding the question.\nThank you for the write up.\nNow select the moduleand list the options.\nHow do we do this?\nThat was on me for not understanding it,but it did trip me out.\nNow select the module is like one part.List the options.\nHow do we list the options?\nWould have just made my brainunderstand that a little bit better.\nI was like, how do I select it,and what’s the option?\nHow do I just select it first?\nOkay, I was doing it,but I didn’t understand anyway.\nCool.\nSo let’s go on to task seven,exploiting SMTP.\nSo let’s go over what do we know?\nOkay, at the end of the enumeration\nsection, we have a few vitalpieces of information.\nWe have a user account,so that was through our top list.\nSo we have administrator.\nAdministrator and a type of SMTPserver and operating system running.\nSo yeah, we know this.\nIt’s running on Ubuntu.\nWe have the name.\nOkay, so we know from our port scan\nthat there’s an open porton this machine is an SSH.\nSo that’s also true.\nWe have an SSH here.\nWe’re going to use this information to try\nand brute force the password of the SSHlogin to our user preparation.\nSo it’s advisablethat you exit metasploit.\nRight nowI’m just going to copy paste this\ninformation, but I knowit’s probably a better way.\nSo I’m just going to copy pastethis and just chuck it over into a file.\nAnd what did we actually find?\nYou know, I’m just goingto call SMTP underscore enum.\nI was going to paste itin there just for our records.\nSo we got a scan.We’ve got everything from there.\nCool.So we can just exit out of everything.\nAnd I don’t think we need checklists over.\nOkay, so now we’re goingto go over to Hydra.\nI believe Hydra is installed,and I have used it.\nCool.\nSo we’re going to be usingso here’s our command, hydrate.\nSo this is going to specify the speed.\nI’m going to play aroundwith that maybe login got username.\nSo we can go down here.\nPoints to the account,points to the file of possible passwords.\nSo in the past, we use Rockyu.\nSo we’re going to be using Rocky againbecause we’re doing passwords VV for both.\nAnd then we’re going to be tryingto exploit the SSH on our machine.\nCool.So this is pretty simple.\nSo we can just follow the bouncing ball.\nSo T for I think it’s threads or amountof tasks is 16,\nbut I think by default, it’s runningat four, but we can go up to 64.\nSo, yeah, I’m just goingto try 64 to see what happens.\nAdministrator and then we’ve got P for thepassword list that we’re going to try.\nSo go user, they go sharewhen you go wordlist.\nThen when you go to the Rocky text file,\nv, uppercase v, specifyour IP and then SSH.\nSo that’s looking pretty good\nas long as I spelled things rightand the 64 doesn’t throw us any errors.\nLet’s try and runthat and see what we get.\nSo revolving both error, error, error.\nSee some more attempts.\nIt’s working pretty fast and wehave a success highlighted here.\nI should have teared this out.\nI forgot to tear it outfor record keeping.\nSo what is the passwordat the enumeration stage?\nSo we’ve got a password here.Great.\nNow let’s log into the SSH.\nSo we can go SSH\nand we can go into adminstrator accountat our IP address and we can hit enter.\nThat’s going to say,hey, sure, fingerprint.\nWhat’s the password?\nCopy that, paste it in thereand hopefully we’re in.\nCool.So let’s list out what we’ve got.\nWe have a dead letter.\nI’m curious, is that what somethingtried to send or something?\nOkay, we have a mail.\nSo I guess this is justa part of the SMTP.\nThen we have an SMTP fileand that is our flag.\nCool.\nCopy that, paste that in,and that is part two complete.\nWell done.\nIf you’re following along at home,congratulations, you’ve made it this far.\nWe’ve only got one more part of three or\nfour tasks left of this room,so that should be up soon.\nIf you’ve enjoyed this video,thank you very much for following along.\nIf you got this far, congratulations.It’s very cool.\nI hope you’ve learned something and I hope\nthat you’re going well on yourcybersecurity journey.\nI will see you in the next one.\nThanks for staying around.\n","wordCount":"3456","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-07-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mr

back.</p><p>We are going to be doing the restof Network services two.</p><p>And this is now part two.</p><p>We’re going on to SMTP.</p><p>So we’re going to be doingtasks five, six and seven.</p><p>And then we’ll be finishing off8910 eleven in the next video.</p><p>If you want a written write up,the link will be below.</p><p>And if you need anythingelse, please reach out.</p><p>And if you want to like videosubscribe, do all that stuff.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Okay, with that all out of the way,let’s go to task six and just hit Start</p><p>machine so we can get our VM up andrunning and we’ll go over to task five.</p><p>Understanding SMTP and wecan just go on here.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>So it stands for Simple Mail Transfer</p><p>protocol is utilized to handlethe sending of emails.</p><p>So you probably use this protocolbefore whether you knew it or not.</p><p>And in order for this to work,</p><p>there are a pair of support emailservices compromising of Pop and IMAP.</p><p>Together they allow the user to send</p><p>outgoing mail and retrieveincoming mail respectively.</p><p>So, SMTP server performsthree basic functions.</p><p>So it Verifies who is sendingthe emails through the SMTP server.</p><p>It sends the outgoing mail and if</p><p>the outgoing mail can’t be delivered,it sends the message back to the sender.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>So most people will have encountered SNCPwhen configuring a new email address</p><p>on some third party emailclients such as Thunderbird.</p><p>I’ve had done this like setting upfor friends or family or for work purposes</p><p>and as when you configurea new email client.</p><p>Cool.So Pop and IMAP.</p><p>So Post Office Protocol and thenInternet Message Access Protocol.</p><p>So they’re both email protocols who are</p><p>responsible for transfer of emailsbetween client and a mail server.</p><p>The main difference is Pop’s moresimplistic approach of downloading</p><p>the inbox from the mail serverto the client, where IMAP will synchronize</p><p>the current inbox with the newmail on the server.</p><p>Those two options are sort of like</p><p>the implementation of IMAP personallyand downloading anything new.</p><p>So this means that changes to the inboxmade on the computer over IMAP will assist</p><p>if you synchronize and then synchronizethe inbox from other computer.</p><p>Popper imapse is responsiblefor fulfilling this process.</p><p>So how does it work?</p><p>We have a little diagram here.</p><p>Email delivery functions much the sameway as physical email delivery system.</p><p>User will supply the email</p><p>a letter and service the postal deliveryservice and through a series of steps</p><p>we’ll deliver it to the recipient’sinbox or post box.</p><p>So the role of the SMTP server in thisservice is to act as the sorting office.</p><p>So the email is picked up and sent</p><p>to the server, which thendirects it to the recipient.</p><p>We can map the journey of an email</p><p>from computer looking likethis user to the server.</p><p>SMTP server going out, pinging around,</p><p>going to the i, map or Pop serverand then going to the recipient.</p><p>So it lists out the order.</p><p>Going to just skip past this for now.</p><p>And there’s a good article here,which another article is on my read list.</p><p>What runs SMTP software is readilyavailable on Windows Server platforms,</p><p>with many other variantsbeing available on links.</p><p>Windows Server,</p><p>they’ve got email client Bob server justbuilt into it if you activate it,</p><p>more information if you want technicaldevice implementation of it, go like that.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>All right, let’s go overthe questions together.</p><p>And we’ve got what does SMTP stand for?So we had it up here.</p><p>We’ve got simple mail transferprotocol so we can pop that in.</p><p>What does Smt handle?</p><p>The sending of so what does ithelp or what does it actually send?</p><p>Emails.Yeah.</p><p>39, baby.</p><p>What is the first step in the Smt process?That’s what I skipped.</p><p>So let’s go back here.</p><p>So we’ve got the mail user agent,which is either your email client or</p><p>external program, connectsto the server of your name.</p><p>So connects or something.</p><p>So we wantthe mail user agent connects to the SMTP</p><p>service domain,initiates the SMTP handshake.</p><p>That’s what we’re looking for.</p><p>So it connects, but it authenticates.</p><p>This connection works over SMTP port,which is usually 25.</p><p>So looking for the SMTP handshakeand what is the default port?</p><p>25.That’s the well known port.</p><p>Something that’s good to memorize,I definitely have.</p><p>Where does SMTP service send the email?</p><p>If the recipient service is not available,it can’t be accessed.</p><p>Unavailable email gets put into the SMTP</p><p>if it can’t reach it.</p><p>If the recipient server can’t be accessed</p><p>or is not available,the email gets put into an smtpq.</p><p>Okay, not exactly back to the sender on.</p><p>What server does the emailultimately end up on?</p><p>So it’s either pop or IMAP.</p><p>So we can use that diagram,</p><p>ultimately ends up here and thenconnects or gets sent to the recipient.</p><p>But ultimately it’son the server, I guess.</p><p>Can a Linux machine run an SMTP server?</p><p>Yeah, pretty sure everything can.A Windows?</p><p>Well, yeah, it’s sammy builtinto the system once you turn it on.</p><p>So yeah.Cool.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>All right, we are up to the next one,is going to ping our IP.</p><p>So we’re going to go on to task six,enumerating SMTP.</p><p>So we’ll probably start with another port</p><p>scan against the targetmachine and we’ll see.</p><p>So we’ll do what we’ve beendoing and we’ll run Nmap now.</p><p>And then we’ll go through.</p><p>So I found that this</p><p>string or string this set of switchesfor the Nmap command,</p><p>running A and running T four speeds upthe process and doing all the ports.</p><p>This has been working quite well.</p><p>I still am skeptical of the T four</p><p>speeding it up, but sofar things going well.</p><p>So we’re going to run that.</p><p>And as that’s running in the background,I can see 25 already.</p><p>So I know that’s defaultfrom the last task.</p><p>So that’s cool.That’s the default SMTP.</p><p>Okay, so let’s get started.</p><p>Before we begin, make sure to deploythe room check and enrolling service.</p><p>Poorly configured or vulnerable mail</p><p>servers can often provide initialfootholds into our network.</p><p>But prior to launching intact,we want to fingerprint the server.</p><p>Fingerprint the server to make ourtargeting as precise as possible.</p><p>Is that sort of this term, fingerprinting?</p><p>Is that sort of just like</p><p>a way of when you’ve got you’reenumerating,</p><p>you’re getting like a fingerprint,something unique to identify servers.</p><p>That’s sort of what that means.</p><p>Not sure, but it sounds cool.</p><p>We’re going to use the SMTPversion module in Metasploit.</p><p>Metasploit is an awesomeframework that can do a lot.</p><p>There’s a couple of rooms and try Hack Mejust dedicated to learning this tool.</p><p>So it’s good to go over this to keeplearning it because it’s massive.</p><p>So there’s a set of modules builtaround enumerating or exploiting SMTP.</p><p>So that’s cool.</p><p>As its name implies,it will scan a range of IP addresses</p><p>and determine the version of anymail servers it encounters.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Enumerating users from SMTP.</p><p>So the SMTP services has two internalcommands that allow the enumeration</p><p>of users vrrfy,confirming the names of valid users,</p><p>and X-E-X-P-N which reveals the actualaddress of users aliases, endless email.</p><p>That’s kind of cool that we can pull</p><p>that out without going on to itor accessing it.</p><p>Using the SMTP commands,we can reveal a list of valid users.</p><p>Okay, we can do this manuallyover a telnet connection.</p><p>However, Metasploit comes into the rescue,writing a handy module appropriately</p><p>called SMTP enum for enumerationthat will do the legwork for us.</p><p>Using the module is a simple matterof feeding it a host or range of hosts</p><p>to scan with a wordlist containingusernames to enumerate.</p><p>So we mighthave some usernames given to us or we</p><p>might have to use just a randomword list of generic usernames.</p><p>We’ll see what instructions give us,</p><p>but we’ve definitely got ourhost that we can plug into it.</p><p>So your requirements as we’re going to be</p><p>using Metasploit for this, it’s importantthat you have Metasploit installed.</p><p>It is by default.</p><p>So if you need it, you can go Apt install.</p><p>I think it’s MSF console or Metasploit.</p><p>It might probably tell us,but it’s one of those.</p><p>But yeah, we should probably do an Apt</p><p>update and upgradeand do that in the background.</p><p>Okay, so we’re all good.</p><p>We can do Apt order remove,get rid of some old packages.</p><p>Cool.Okay.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you’re checking</p><p>will work for the majorityof SMCP configurations.</p><p>However, there are other non metasploittools such as SMCP User enum that work</p><p>even better for enumerating OS level useraccounts on solaris bias, and CV service.</p><p>Enumeration is performedby inspecting the responses.</p><p>All these different sowhat were these again?</p><p>These were SMCP services.</p><p>So it tries to get responses from these.Okay.</p><p>Sort of understanding it.</p><p>The technique could be adapted in future</p><p>to work against othervulnerable SMCP diamonds.</p><p>But this hasn’t been doneat the time of writing.</p><p>It’s an alternative that’s worthkeeping in mind preparation.</p><p>Okay, cool.</p><p>So let’s run a port scanagainst the target machine.</p><p>Same as last time.What port is SMTP running on?</p><p>So my port scan is still goingand it’s going to go for a while.</p><p>So let’s try and see if we canjust answer these as it’s running.</p><p>Okay, so it’s definitely on 25,</p><p>and that’s based on this firstport that’s the scan has told.</p><p>And if your skin isn’t showing anything,make sure you use your VB for talkative.</p><p>That’s going to see all this informationabout what our scans actually doing.</p><p>Okay, now we know what port we should betargeting, let’s start up metasploit.</p><p>What command do we use?</p><p>So I’m just going to go and open a new</p><p>terminal here and just letthat run in the background.</p><p>I’m just going to go over to our system.</p><p>So we’ve got our scan happening at themoment, so we’ll just let that run.</p><p>So for this we use MSF console.</p><p>So we should have MSF console.</p><p>And let’s search the module SMTPso we can use Q to enter quietly.</p><p>So usually you get a big oldbanner message, which is fine.</p><p>You can just run MSF consoleand just open it up.</p><p>Just Q can take a little while.</p><p>I might need to run MSF console and knit</p><p>or Msfdb and it but looks like we’reworking so we can search for Smt.</p><p>SMTP underscore version.</p><p>So here we’ve got.</p><p>Set as ID zero.</p><p>So this is like our search results.</p><p>And if there were other things thatmatched this, we would get a big list.</p><p>012-3456 seven.</p><p>So this is just set to zero isthe first one that’s come back.</p><p>Cool.So this is probably what we’re after.</p><p>So what’s the full module name?</p><p>We got it now.Great.</p><p>Now select the module in the list.</p><p>How do we do this?</p><p>It tells us here.</p><p>So we can go info zero if we wantto find out more information.</p><p>Or we can just go use zero.</p><p>So we can just go use zero,but it’s not looking for that.</p><p>Don’t know.I’m going to come back to that one.</p><p>Have a look through the options.</p><p>Does everything seem correct?</p><p>What is the option we need to set?</p><p>So we definitely need to set.</p><p>Okay, we’ll look it up.</p><p>So we’ve just used zero.</p><p>So that selected our tool.</p><p>This is going to be the tool orthe module that we’re using.</p><p>And we need to set it up.</p><p>We can’t just set up so we can usenot get was it set?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So if we look at set, we can maybe</p><p>know the differencebetween certain options.</p><p>But if we just type in options,we’ve got Rhosts, R port and threads.</p><p>Okay, so all three of thesethings are required.</p><p>We can see here the port that we’respecifying is already set to default 25.</p><p>Because that’s the defaultof SMTP, I assume.</p><p>So cool.</p><p>But then the rhost.</p><p>So this is the actual host or the IP orthe machine that we’re wanting to target.</p><p>So we can go set Rhosts to and justpaste in our IP address like that.</p><p>That confirms with ourhost is equal to that.</p><p>So if you just want to confirm that,you can type in your options again.</p><p>And now we can see that.Indeed.</p><p>We’ve got it there.Awesome.</p><p>So the last step of our thing,we can just hit run, but.</p><p>Let’S.Just finish this off.</p><p>So we got our host.</p><p>I honestly do not know what that is.</p><p>Set the correct value of your targetmachine, then run the exploit.</p><p>What’s the system mail name?</p><p>So we can just run run orwe can just run exploit.</p><p>These all sort of just work that willtarget the system with this payload.</p><p>Okay, so we’ve got SMTP polo, SMTP home.</p><p>So it looks like that’s the systemmail name that we’re looking for.</p><p>So what was our hand?Looks roughly like an email address.</p><p>Sort of what mail transferagent MCA is running.</p><p>So if we have a look, this could post fix.</p><p>Might be our mail agent.That’s our mail agent.</p><p>If you need to send a letter, you post it.</p><p>So that was the hint where you post fix.</p><p>That’s the mail transfer agent MCA.</p><p>Not exactly sure what that is.</p><p>I don’t remember that showing up.</p><p>I may have skipped over.</p><p>That another one.</p><p>To lock that in.</p><p>Okay, good.</p><p>Now you’ve got a good amount</p><p>of information on the targetto move on to the next stage.</p><p>Let’s search for the SMTP enumso we don’t have to exit or go back.</p><p>We can just use searchhere and we can find it.</p><p>So again, we can just go use zero because</p><p>on the list it’s the first oneand computers start at zero.</p><p>So we’re going to go use zero.</p><p>And we can see here ourprompt has actually changed.</p><p>So we no longer selected this.</p><p>We’ve now selected SMTP.</p><p>So that’s just asking,what’s the full name?</p><p>This is good.</p><p>This is making sure that we’re actuallyusing the right tool like this.</p><p>We’re going to be usingthe top usernames shortlist.</p><p>No.Is my scan still going yet?</p><p>I actually don’t know what this is.</p><p>Let me just open up.</p><p>I’m going to have to download it.</p><p>I don’t have it.</p><p>I’ve seen a couple of people use this</p><p>locate commands to try and find any filelike that, but I don’t have it by default.</p><p>So we’ll have to download it.</p><p>So it’s amazing collection of Wordlist.</p><p>If you’re running Carly Parrot,install Seclists.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>It’s a part of Seclist,so we can just go apt install seclists</p><p>and that’ll grab that for usand then we should have it.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>I am going to try that locate tool againonce this downloads,</p><p>just to see what options do weneed to set in the Word lists.</p><p>So if we go options again,we’ve got our host.</p><p>So we need to set ourhost and then use a file.</p><p>So this is going to be our Wordlist.</p><p>So we can see here by default.</p><p>We’ve got Unix usernamesset, so that’s cool.</p><p>If we just ran this, we may have a chance.</p><p>So I’m just going to look up thisand see if I can okay, so this is it.</p><p>This is the raw list.</p><p>So not that big of a list at all.</p><p>I’m fairly confident if I just use thatother default list that it would work.</p><p>What I’m going to do is I’m just going toget this right here.</p><p>I’ve got to go back here and we’regoing to set the user file to this.</p><p>And now I know the file there and I’mgoing to run it and hopefully see</p><p>something different because weactually have fed a wordlist into it.</p><p>So since it’s not that long,it shouldn’t take that long.</p><p>So it’s under usernames.</p><p>Was there a usernames?</p><p>Man, I’m so blind.</p><p>I didn’t even see that.</p><p>Okay, can we just list outwhat’s in the usernames?</p><p>And there it is.</p><p>Okay, I swear I do this.</p><p>I just find the longest way to do things.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>We have got it working.</p><p>Even if I do things the wrong way,I’m going to pause the video.</p><p>No, I’m not.Here we are.</p><p>I will pause the video to figureout what the hell that question is.</p><p>But we have foundadministrator has worked.</p><p>So that’s cool.And my skin finished.</p><p>I’m just going to cap thisout and grab three open.</p><p>So still only two ports open.</p><p>Good that we did the whole scan justin case there was something else.</p><p>So what was it?</p><p>Administrator?</p><p>I’m so dumb.</p><p>I just wasn’t understanding the question.</p><p>Thank you for the write up.</p><p>Now select the moduleand list the options.</p><p>How do we do this?</p><p>That was on me for not understanding it,but it did trip me out.</p><p>Now select the module is like one part.List the options.</p><p>How do we list the options?</p><p>Would have just made my brainunderstand that a little bit better.</p><p>I was like, how do I select it,and what’s the option?</p><p>How do I just select it first?</p><p>Okay, I was doing it,but I didn’t understand anyway.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>So let’s go on to task seven,exploiting SMTP.</p><p>So let’s go over what do we know?</p><p>Okay, at the end of the enumeration</p><p>section, we have a few vitalpieces of information.</p><p>We have a user account,so that was through our top list.</p><p>So we have administrator.</p><p>Administrator and a type of SMTPserver and operating system running.</p><p>So yeah, we know this.</p><p>It’s running on Ubuntu.</p><p>We have the name.</p><p>Okay, so we know from our port scan</p><p>that there’s an open porton this machine is an SSH.</p><p>So that’s also true.</p><p>We have an SSH here.</p><p>We’re going to use this information to try</p><p>and brute force the password of the SSHlogin to our user preparation.</p><p>So it’s advisablethat you exit metasploit.</p><p>Right nowI’m just going to copy paste this</p><p>information, but I knowit’s probably a better way.</p><p>So I’m just going to copy pastethis and just chuck it over into a file.</p><p>And what did we actually find?</p><p>You know, I’m just goingto call SMTP underscore enum.</p><p>I was going to paste itin there just for our records.</p><p>So we got a scan.We’ve got everything from there.</p><p>Cool.So we can just exit out of everything.</p><p>And I don’t think we need checklists over.</p><p>Okay, so now we’re goingto go over to Hydra.</p><p>I believe Hydra is installed,and I have used it.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>So we’re going to be usingso here’s our command, hydrate.</p><p>So this is going to specify the speed.</p><p>I’m going to play aroundwith that maybe login got username.</p><p>So we can go down here.</p><p>Points to the account,points to the file of possible passwords.</p><p>So in the past, we use Rockyu.</p><p>So we’re going to be using Rocky againbecause we’re doing passwords VV for both.</p><p>And then we’re going to be tryingto exploit the SSH on our machine.</p><p>Cool.So this is pretty simple.</p><p>So we can just follow the bouncing ball.</p><p>So T for I think it’s threads or amountof tasks is 16,</p><p>but I think by default, it’s runningat four, but we can go up to 64.</p><p>So, yeah, I’m just goingto try 64 to see what happens.</p><p>Administrator and then we’ve got P for thepassword list that we’re going to try.</p><p>So go user, they go sharewhen you go wordlist.</p><p>Then when you go to the Rocky text file,</p><p>v, uppercase v, specifyour IP and then SSH.</p><p>So that’s looking pretty good</p><p>as long as I spelled things rightand the 64 doesn’t throw us any errors.</p><p>Let’s try and runthat and see what we get.</p><p>So revolving both error, error, error.</p><p>See some more attempts.</p><p>It’s working pretty fast and wehave a success highlighted here.</p><p>I should have teared this out.</p><p>I forgot to tear it outfor record keeping.</p><p>So what is the passwordat the enumeration stage?</p><p>So we’ve got a password here.Great.</p><p>Now let’s log into the SSH.</p><p>So we can go SSH</p><p>and we can go into adminstrator accountat our IP address and we can hit enter.</p><p>That’s going to say,hey, sure, fingerprint.</p><p>What’s the password?</p><p>Copy that, paste it in thereand hopefully we’re in.</p><p>Cool.So let’s list out what we’ve got.</p><p>We have a dead letter.</p><p>I’m curious, is that what somethingtried to send or something?</p><p>Okay, we have a mail.</p><p>So I guess this is justa part of the SMTP.</p><p>Then we have an SMTP fileand that is our flag.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>Copy that, paste that in,and that is part two complete.</p><p>Well done.</p><p>If you’re following along at home,congratulations, you’ve made it this far.</p><p>We’ve only got one more part of three or</p><p>four tasks left of this room,so that should be up soon.</p><p>If you’ve enjoyed this video,thank you very much for following along.</p><p>If you got this far, congratulations.It’s very cool.</p><p>I hope you’ve learned something and I hope</p><p>that you’re going well on yourcybersecurity
