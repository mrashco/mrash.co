You may have noticed I‚Äôm writing again, yes that‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm sticking to good habits and moving forward!\nWhat is Business Coaching? Dan Sullivan‚Äôs Coaching: The #1 Industry For The 21st Century explains what business coaching is.\nI never understood business coaching, sports coaching makes sense though! Teams need someone to align their goals and tactics, but a business owner? Why would a business owner need someone to help them run their business?\nThe role of a business coach is to make the business owner‚Äôs path clearer for them. What are some important goals, tasks, roles etc? So it is like a sporting coach after all.\nHe makes a great point that a business coach doesn‚Äôt need to know your business, you know your business. But they do need to challenge your thinking and your decisions to give you clarity.\nThis has made me reconsider the value business coaching brings to me as a business owner.\nHow to Trick Your Brain into Learning More? Mark Rober gave this TED talk The Super Mario Effect ‚Äì Tricking Your Brain into Learning More. He‚Äôs a YouTuber and he questions traditional learning methods by using game mechanics.\nRober says how to turn passing assessment, into passing game levels. Instead of a fear of failing, there‚Äôs a natural fight to overcome obstacles to improve one‚Äôs skill.\nMany universities and schools around the world are using this style of learning. It‚Äôs gone beyond gamification, due to video games like Minecraft: Education Edition.\nThe mind-shift is to focus on the end goal NOT the failures along the way. I hear students say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù. I try to reassure them it‚Äôs okay not to know,it‚Äôs why they‚Äôre here to learn.\nSo as Mark puts it, focus on the princess, not the pits, i.e. stick with a task and learn more.\nMaker or Manager Schedule, What‚Äôs Yours? Tim Ferris and Daniel Ek, shared an article by Paul Graham called Maker‚Äôs Schedule, Manager‚Äôs Schedule. It‚Äôs a short read which explains the thinking behind two types of workers, makers and managers.\nMakers are creators like programmers or product designers. Their focus is on the project in front of them, meetings are often distractions and can create worry.\nManagers are, well, managers ‚Äì the higher-ups or bosses of the world. Their schedule is people-focused and meetings are variables throughout their entire day.\nThis struck a chord with me as my team and I are all makers. As teachers, our focus or project is our classroom of students in front of us. Meetings breakup our workflow and generally create stress as it pulls us out of our purpose.\nEven as a freelance web designer, client meetings can bother me. I‚Äôm more interested in the client‚Äôs project than the project meetings.\nMeetings are important, makers see that. It‚Äôs making everyone aware that meetings impact us in different ways. If we can be aware of each other‚Äôs schedules, we create better working environments.\nYou Need 1000 True Fans, That‚Äôs It? Kevin Kelly author of The Inevitable published 1000 True Fans on his website. It‚Äôs an article arguing content creators don‚Äôt need millions of followers, but 1000. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.\nKelly explains today‚Äôs technology is connecting creators to fans like never before. Using simple math, $100 profit for 1000 fans equals $100,000, his argument becomes sound.\nThere‚Äôs no free ride in life, building an audience worth of 1000 fans takes effort and energy.\nThere‚Äôs no free ride in life, building an audience worth 1000 fans takes effort and energy. But if you love what you do then do it!\nHence why I‚Äôm writing my letters to you, blog posts for searchers and videos for watchers. I want to find my 1000 true fans, don‚Äôt you?\nMore Found Goodness üéß #484: Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify ‚Äî Habits, Systems and Mental Models for Top Performance.
