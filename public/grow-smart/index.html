Bitter as we‚Äôve loved our time relaxing at home, sweet as we‚Äôre looking forward to the routine work brings.\nHere‚Äôs awesome content that I‚Äôve learnt from this week.\n1. Stay Small with Scalable Systems I‚Äôve wasn‚Äôt a big reader growing up but I‚Äôve learnt how valuable it is over the last two years. It‚Äôs lead me to reading more books then I‚Äôve ever read in my life, even if it takes me ages.\nI‚Äôm up to chapter 8 in the Company Of One, which is about simple and repeatable systems to facilitate scale in business.\nHere are a few notes:\nTechnology like social media \u0026 newsletters create one-to-many relationships. They require same the effort for one email to one person as an email to 50,000 people. Products that take little/no management \u0026 charge one-time fee. Creation / connection as a scalable system. Don‚Äôt choose profits over people, shift toward slower, smaller, on-demand strategies e.g. slow fashion. Build relationships, trust and revenue giving ‚Äòon-demand‚Äù information OR increase customer education/retention. This chapter has reassured me how smart growth is possible by approaching business systematically. Breaking larger tasks down into steps becomes a more valuable skill as businesses change.\n2. Burn Bad Habits and Feed Good Goals My brother-in-law recommended ‚ÄòBurn Fat, Feed Muscle‚Äô by Tom Venuto. I‚Äôve ignored fitness books/content due to insecurities and negative thinking. I‚Äôm so thankful I was shown this book, it‚Äôs an absolute treasure!\nI‚Äôve listened to ‚ÄòChapter 6: Setting Goals and Training Your Mind‚Äô nearly four times! I have a fascination with our mind‚Äôs power and those who tap into it. I believe we all have high achieving qualities in us, we simply need to unlock them.\nHere are three steps to set goals and unlock your high achievement.\nSet ideal goals : Your dreams, hopes and the seemingly unrealistic future you, e.g. I want to have a fit, tone body and be proud of what I look like. Write goals as affirmations : Turn them into first person, current realities for your subconscious e.g. I have a fit, tone body and I‚Äôm proud of what I look like. Read aloud every day: Each morning and night, say your ideal goal as an affirmation to yourself. Overtime we build habits from what we tell ourselves, i.e. we follow what we think. It‚Äôs time I (we) start thinking toward my ideal future self and achieve what I really want in life.\n3. Being Human via Good Tape If you didn‚Äôt know, I unintentionally started a podcast from writing blog posts. I wanted to give readers an option to listen which naturally lead to them being audio episodes.\nIt‚Äôs a goal I‚Äôve always put off but not anymore! As per usual, I deep dive into subjects to understand them. This takes form in finding and consuming a lot of content.\nI started at my podcast host who provided two free courses, they were good introductions. That lead to finding Spotify‚Äôs resources for podcasters and their Gimlet Academy. That was perfect!\nHere‚Äôs an over simplifed breakdown of the Gimlet Academy:\nPitch: Perfecting the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô by giving people a reason to care. Booking: Be creative, be human, try try again, strike while the iron is hot. What: Balance stories and emotion. How: Prep docs with story chapters, trust your gut. Wrap: Beginning, middle and end. I understand the difference between a podcast as an amateur (where I am) and a professional (where I want to be). There‚Äôs a big difference.\nI‚Äôm committed to writing a blog post every two weeks and turning it into a podcast episode. Overtime I‚Äôll bridge the gap between amateur and professional, follow my journey!\nThanks for reading!\nü¶à Shark Tank Australia: Deep dive into decoding various pitches to investors. Upcoming blog post.\nüÜï Updated Newsletter Pages: Check out the refresh on my newsletter pages built-in Elementor. I‚Äôve used substack as subtle inspiration with a desire to simplify.\n","wordCount":"676","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519846270463-e778b6624baf?ixid=MXwxNTI0MzJ8MHwxfGFsbHx8fHx8fHx8\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026fm=jpg\u0026q=85\u0026fit=crop\u0026w=1080\u0026h=auto","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mr Ash"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//localhost:1313/grow-smart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mr Ash Co","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/Jrum0N6q/4ab8cbb7-d222-4c3c-963d-f0ec6c30568c.jpg?source=viewer\u0026v=db94595858aad20b777e4f130cbe5006"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=//localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="mrashco (Alt + H)">mrashco</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=//localhost:1313/now title=now><span>now</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/post title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/note title=notes><span>notes</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/letter title=letters><span>letters</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/search title=" (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="17.5" height="17.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="11" cy="11" r="8"/><line x1="21" y1="21" x2="16.65" y2="16.65"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=//localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=//localhost:1313/letter/>Letters</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Grow Smart</h1><div class=post-meta>4 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;676 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Mr Ash&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/mrashco/mrash.co/tree/main/content/letter/2021/jan-3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Edits</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519846270463-e778b6624baf?ixid=MXwxNTI0MzJ8MHwxfGFsbHx8fHx8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=85&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1080&amp;h=auto" alt></figure><div class=post-content><p>Hello friend,</p><p>How has your week been?</p><p>It‚Äôs a bittersweet week for me and my wife as it‚Äôs the last week of holidays before work.
