      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s learn Docker and set it up.
So what&amp;rsquo;s Docker?
Well it&amp;rsquo;s complicated.
It&amp;rsquo;s a way to install, maintain and run applications.
But apps are self-contained, hence the term containers.
Docker allows networking and lots more.
Installing Docker Best way is to follow the docs.
Kali Linux If you&amp;rsquo;re on Kali Linux, don&amp;rsquo;t follow the official guide.
Go to Installing Docker on Kali Linux from Kali.org instead.
sudo apt update sudo apt install -y docker.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s setup a new &amp;ldquo;Hack Box&amp;rdquo; for TryHackMe challenges and Capture The Flags (CTFs).
Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Kali Rolling inside of VirtualBox. But let&amp;rsquo;s try and get away from Virtual Machines (VMs).
Why? Mainly the boot times, slow browsing and general laggy annoyances.
I want a fast, simple system without the need to boot a VM and deal with stutters.
The thinking is, use Windows Subset for Linux (WSL) with headless Kali Linux.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of YouTuber Ali Abdaal, his ex-PA now turned YouTuber Elizabeth Flipis has a great channel. She creates content about herself living in London while studying Medschool.
Her latest video You&amp;rsquo;re Not Stupid: How to Easily Learn Difficult Things caught my attention. As someone who feels dumb 90% of the time, this is perfect, and the timing couldn&amp;rsquo;t be better as I&amp;rsquo;m learning computer science and programming.</description>

      <description>Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is an incredible book, and course by Al Sweigart to learn Python coding and computer science for the everyday person. With its straightforward learning approach, and succinct program examples and explanations, it’s many hobbyists’ go-to book for Python.
This article breaks down my personal solutions to the practice projects outlined at the end of most chapters. As I continue to learn Python and generally computer science, I enjoy seeing how others solve coding problems.</description>

      <description>In March 2022, some friends of mine got scammed on Instagram. A scammer posing as a friend or work colleague tricked them into “helping” them out and took over their account.
It’s motivated me to help those I know and love by being more aware of the dangers that lurk on the internet. The reality is, that the internet is full of your personally identifiable information (PII) being leaked and publically available.</description>

Homelabs can be anything from old laptops to expensive high-end enterprise equipment.
Typically, you’ll find homelabs involve a lot of virtual computers, meaning they’re not physical. There’s little entry to get started and unlimited possibility as your homelab grows.
You’ll find techies and sys-admins from all over the world who love to share their homelabs, projects and builds.</description>

      <description>Wanting to learn Python?
Of course you do!
Python is the hacker’s language, it’s more modern than bash and it’s super cool.
If you’ve never programmed or wrote a line of code, that’s okay! We all have to start somewhere.
There’s a lot of good places to learn Python, I recommend Automate The Boring Stuff with Python and the official Python Documentation Tutorial.

This is a beginner ‘easy’ game, their description reads a CTF for beginners, can you root me? If you’re unaware, root means top-level access, like super admin or master-of-everything.
When you gain root-level access, you own that machine, so install, delete, copy or whatever else you want, it’s yours.</description>

Looking forward is hard. The future is a fantasy. No one knows what’s happening tomorrow. But looking back is tangible. I like tangible. So here’s my look back at the past 12 months. Ups, downs and the honesty in-between.

How’s your week been?
Mines been mixed, it’s been good back at work but draining. We had 2-3 days of virtual meetings/events. After an hour or so, there’s only so much new info my brain can absorb.
It’s been great seeing the team but a bit uncharted as I’m taking on my new teaching position. Still unclear how it’s all going to play out of the next 2-3 weeks.</description>

      <description>Hello friend,
How has your week been?
It’s a bittersweet week for me and my wife as it’s the last week of holidays before work. Bitter as we’ve loved our time relaxing at home, sweet as we’re looking forward to the routine work brings.
Here’s awesome content that I’ve learnt from this week.

      <description>Hello friend,
How has your week been? Reply and tell me one nice thing that you experienced.
My week has been good. It’s the second last week of the holidays! I’ve loved creating more content over this time. But I’m worried about going back to work and balancing the goals I’ve set for myself.

      <description>Hi friend,
It&amp;rsquo;s nice writing to you again, I hope you had a nice break over the holidays. As more people (like Aussies) are working from home more than ever before, myself included, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss having a healthy home work-life.

I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you someone I found while scrolling through Twitter.
It all started with “I&amp;rsquo;d like to try something new…”
That was enough to get my attention.
As of writing this letter, it was a couple of weeks ago now. Wow time moves fast.

      <description>Hi friend,
We made it through April, I hope you’ve had a good month and you’re doing well. Warning, this letter is self-indulgent so if that’s not your thing, I understand, you can read the blog posts under Months Memories below.
Let’s chat, I was really lazy this month, honestly, I had a tough week or two throughout April, my brain spiralled leaving me pretty lost. So I thought it’d be beneficial to explore the habit of laziness and how it impacts me and probably you too.</description>

      <description>Hi friend,
I hope your November has been well, question, do you write a lot? Generally, most people write or type daily as it&amp;rsquo;s fundamental to their job or life. It&amp;rsquo;s also the basis of how computer programs are made so it&amp;rsquo;s sort of what the entire tech world is built on. Writing is how we share information, how we teach and provide knowledge. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how writing independently can improve our lives.</description>

      <description>Hello friend,
How has your week been? Reply amd tell me.
My week feels long. Not sure why. It’s been full of family gatherings and time spent with those closest. I hope it’s been the same for you. This issue is focused on looking inward. I’ve found the more we discover ourselves, the better we can contribute to others.

Can you believe it&amp;rsquo;s the end of 2020?
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a good week since we last spoke, for me, it&amp;rsquo;s been really nice as it&amp;rsquo;s the second week left of work for the year! Woo-hoo! Very excited for the holidays.
My wife and I, with a few friends, managed to take a short trip to Rainbow Beach for a few days. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in Queensland, make sure to visit the sand dunes called the “Blow Hole”, it&amp;rsquo;s incredible.</description>

      <description>Hi friend,
Hope you’re safe and well during the last 28(ish) days since I wrote to you. It’s so sad to see countries on the brink of war in the modern era, hoping peace comes soon for everything going on.
On a lighter note, let’s discuss ‘putting yourself out there’ - no this isn’t dating advice, but more life/work observations. I’ve found benefits from writing on the internet, sharing lessons and helping others, but it takes effort.</description>

      <description>Hello friend,
How’s your week been?
Professionally, it’s a good one for me. I’ve been back into work by setting up students for their course.
Personally, I’ve been slightly neglecting my morning routine and slipping on positive habits. I think getting back into work is draining me more than I was expecting. I need to find a new balance being back in work mode.
As always, aligning myself with my 2020 yearly review I’m writing to you.</description>

      <description>Hey friend,
Can you believe it&amp;rsquo;s the end of another month? Four weeks can go so fast! October&amp;rsquo;s been about goals, dreams, and the power of compounding habits to achieve them.
Compound, claimed to be the eighth wonder of the world (it is for investing), but what is it? Put simply, compound is the long term effects of small steps. For example, going to the gym once every couple of days shows little result, but that habit compounded over years returns massive gains.</description>
