And don’t forget to watch the video walkthrough.
Welcome to your Intro to PyScript, a simple replit that teaches you the basics of the modern Python web dev technology. You’re going to set up your own simple HTML page with a linked Python program. You’ll enable PyScript, take user data, run it through your program and print it back out to the user.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of YouTuber Ali Abdaal, his ex-PA now turned YouTuber Elizabeth Flipis has a great channel. She creates content about herself living in London while studying Medschool.
Her latest video You&amp;rsquo;re Not Stupid: How to Easily Learn Difficult Things caught my attention. As someone who feels dumb 90% of the time, this is perfect, and the timing couldn&amp;rsquo;t be better as I&amp;rsquo;m learning computer science and programming.</description>

      <description>Automate The Boring Stuff With Python is an incredible book, and course by Al Sweigart to learn Python coding and computer science for the everyday person. With its straightforward learning approach, and succinct program examples and explanations, it’s many hobbyists’ go-to book for Python.
This article breaks down my personal solutions to the practice projects outlined at the end of most chapters. As I continue to learn Python and generally computer science, I enjoy seeing how others solve coding problems.</description>

      <description>So you’re learning Python and want to understand the range function, welcome!
The range function paired with a for loop is a great way to repeat code a number of times.
Let’s learn the basics of the range function with Python and then it’s over to you for a little project.
Basics Let’s have a simple counter go from 1 to 5, and show the results as it counts.</description>

      <description>Let’s learn some Python!
Want an easy python program to get started? Here’s zigzag.
This program is from Automate The Boring Stuff With Python Chapter 3, under A Short Program: Zigzag.
Welcome to my third study session to learn Python Programming! The video above covers the entire process of copying the zig zag program from Automate The Boring Stuff With Python.

      <description>Want an easy python project to get you started learning python?
Here’s a random number generator built-in python!
See the project live below or via GitHub.
Okay, let’s build your very own number generator python program.
Foundation Let’s write the program in stages.
But first, it’s recommended to write out pseudo code as it helps to map out and plan the program before you deep dive into writing it.</description>

      <description>Usernames, we all have one, maybe for work or on Twitter.
How about a python program that automatically generates a username based on your name?
Sound cool? Let’s make a simple project to generate usernames.
See the live program below:
Disclaimer, this is not a python tutorial, for that, see Intro To Python.
Core Code Let’s get the core elements down for the username generator.
First, displaying the title via print() and then using two variables with input().</description>

      <description>Are you learning Python? Need some beginner Python projects?
It’s nice to have you here, this is my Mad Lib Game, an easy beginner Python Project for you!
Mad Libs are a simple game, it consists of one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.
Instead of a human, we’ll have the computer read them back via the terminal, cool.</description>

      <description>Learning python? It’s an incredible programming language to have in your tool belt.
This project is inspired by an early example from Automate The Boring Stuff with Python.
Flow Control This python project is to impliment this flow chart:
Taken from chapter 2, there’s a few things to digest, see the code step by step in Python Tutor.
Let’s write the steps is psuedoe code:
Ask if it’s raining? If no, go outside.</description>
