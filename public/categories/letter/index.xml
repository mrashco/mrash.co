      <description>Hi friend,
Are you stressed? Most people are despite the ease of modern living. What&amp;rsquo;s something we can do to combat work-life stresses? Disclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you’ve subscribed to Mr Ash.co. Note, this month has a shortened newsletter.
AFK Away From Keyboard (AFK), coined by PC gamers to quickly chat “I’m getting food, don&amp;rsquo;t kill me in game” or something similar. I still use AFK today in work meetings.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s taken me 6 years to start uploading regular videos to YouTube, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a plan. Here&amp;rsquo;s my brand/business plan, and shout out to my wife for helping me, these things are hard.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look back at the last 31 days, discuss the best way to learn cyber security and I’ll share a new project I’m working on. Disclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you subscribed to Mr Ash .co.
the BEST way to learn CyberSec?! If you want into CyberSec then get into Capture The Flags (CTFs), simple. CTFs are gamified learning, I mean, why do people spend so many hours playing video games?</description>
