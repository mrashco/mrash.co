It was a great getaway before lockdown struck.\nLet’s look at once been cooking.\n1. Personal Finance My longest blog post is live and is ready for your viewing pleasure.\nIt’s on finance, a topic that’s never tickled my fancy (if you know what I mean).\nBut now being in my mid-twenties ‘finical independence’ is filling up my search history.\nI blame Scott Pape and his shoe-less attitude toward life. It’s led me toward the FIRE community following the likes of Captain Fi, Mr Money Mustache and more recently Aussie Firebug.\nNow I’m switching Super, changing banks and looking into other Financial Independent (FI) options. If you’ve got any advice, reply to let me know.\nHowever, I’m stumbling on to a lot of “snake oil”… where there’s money, there are scams. Crypto, foreign exchange, single shares… opportunity and traps are blurred.\nBe careful out there! Never send your hard-earned cash ANYWHERE unless it’s a validated, reliable source.\n2. Professional Development I feel like I have two jobs 1) being a teacher in education, and 2) a network admin in tech.\nThis creates an ongoing issue.\nIf I’m a teacher first, how do I improve my tech skillset second?\nEnter, Professional Development (PD), you may/may not have this in your workplace depending on your job.\nFor teachers, it’s massive!\nIn order to stay current with the tech industry, I go to webinar’s, consume content (YouTube, email, Podcasts), participate in events, take courses and create content.\nSome weeks I do a lot of PD, some next to none. For me, it depends on the workload and mental health.\nIf I’m overworked and stressed, the extra time I have is spent relaxing and enjoying time with my wife.\nHow much PD should a teacher do to stay current? Reply and let me know.\n3. Identity Crisis Help please, I’m in an identity crisis with mrash.co.\nSince learning Cyber Security with #100DaysOfHacking. The blog has over 10 posts about hacking, Linux and Cyber Sec.\nBut what about web design, WordPress and Elementor?\nThese topics are what I started as there are ~30 videos on YouTube about them.\nNow I don’t do web design and I’m afraid to make videos about anything else as it will conflict.\nWill it conflict?\nI want to have the ability to make content about a wide range of topics, not just a few.\nBut I also don’t want to confuse viewers.\nIs that possible? Reply and tell me as I don’t know yet.\nEither way, here’s a short-list of what I’ve made in the past 2-3 months:\nHackers Beginner Guide To Online Anonymity Beginner’s Guide To Passive Investing – Income, Tax, Super, Stocks And ETFs WordPress App Won’t Connect To Website – Cloudways Self-Hosted Linux Unhatched Cisco Course Review And Notes Kind regards,\nAsh\nP.S. I’m moving from weekly to monthly newsletters. This comes from a few areas 1) poor time management, 2) losing interest and confidence, 3) lack of enough effort and 4) slow progress results.\nHonestly, I’ve really struggled to keep the weekly routine and even monthly is finding difficult.\nI’m very thankful for you as a reader, you trust me with your data and time!
