Hi friend,

Are you stressed? Most people are despite the ease of modern living. What's something we can do to combat work-life stresses? *Disclaimer, you’ve received this [newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) as you’ve subscribed to [Mr Ash.co](https://mrashleyball.com/). Note, this month has a shortened newsletter.*

## AFK

Away From Keyboard (AFK), coined by PC gamers to quickly chat “I’m getting food, don't kill me in game” or something similar. I still use AFK today in work meetings. Currently, I'm very AFK as my wife and I are on holidays for nearly two weeks. We're in a small coastal town called Port Douglas in North Queensland, Australia.

Every time I get out of my routine I always feel lighter and more refreshed. Taking a break doesn't have to start with a plane or long drive. Maybe just a short trip outside your normal routine is all you need to unwind and refocus. If you can get out of your routine, away from your normal surroundings and try somewhere or something new. You may just feel great being AFK and come back to your work-life refreshed.
