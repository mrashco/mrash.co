Hi friend,

Hope you’re safe and well during the last 28(ish) days since I wrote to you. It’s so sad to see countries on the brink of war in the modern era, hoping peace comes soon for everything going on.

On a lighter note, let’s discuss ‘putting yourself out there’ - no this isn’t dating advice, but more life/work observations. I’ve found benefits from writing on the internet, sharing lessons and helping others, but it takes effort. Is putting yourself out there worth it?

## Put Yourself Out

Let’s quickly define this, it means to be in front of others in a non-typical environment that is difficult for you. Public speaking, posting videos on YouTube, publishing a blog etc. - pick your poison.

Okay, but why? What’s the point in going into new things, uncomfortable situations or putting in more effort than is required? The answer - unexpected delight.

This is known to some as increasing your [Luck Surface Area](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area), a fascinating, simple concept of doing more stuff and telling more people. It’s something [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/2020/01/16/bob-iger/) has touched on before regarding leadership.

How to do it? How do you put yourself out there?

1. Start now: stop saying you’ll start doing the thing you want to do and just start.
2. Learn as you go: aim for progression, not perfection, i.e. [DO WHAT YOU CAN’T](https://youtu.be/jG7dSXcfVqE).
3. Accept failure: mistakes are a part of learning, don’t avoid it. 
4. Enjoy the ride: fall in love with the process, not the end result.

I personally have a website and a YouTube channel where I ‘put myself out’ - I can vouch for the process.

## Catch-Up & Next Steps

*A quick look back at the month and forward to next.*

**Month’s Memories**

- There has been server flooding in Queensland, Australia recently. We are lucky that we’re safe and no damage to our house happened unless, we count our dog freaking out:
