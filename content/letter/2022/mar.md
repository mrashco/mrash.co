Hi friend,

Another four weeks have come and gone, it’s mindboggling to see war expand and produce the largest cyberwar in history. With cybercrime on the up globally, it’s hitting here home in Australia, hear how scammers are taking over Instagram accounts.

*Disclaimer, you’ve received this newsletter as you’re subscribed to [Mr Ash.co](https://mrashleyball.com/) (or downloaded a freebie)/ If interested, read [last month’s](https://mrash.co/letter/put-yourself-out-feb-22/) or see [all newsletters](https://mrash.co/newsletters/), thanks for reading.*

## Staying Safe Online

Over the past few weeks, two friends of mine had their Instagram accounts taken over by a scammer. The scammer posed as a friend or work colleague and tricked them into handing over their accounts.

The scam focuses on hijacking and taking over accounts with social engineering. Once they trick the account owner, they lock them out, change the username, and the profile picture and upload a series of fake, stolen images. They then contact other users as the account owner to find more victims. It’s a series of stolen accounts where the scammer can start fresh with each new account, just awful.

In addition to stealing their account, the scammer tries to trick users into recording and uploading a video promoting their scam. Due to fear or embarrassment, victims unknowingly help the scammer, this happened to one of my friends.

It’s led me to talk to a few friends about basic cyber security awareness, something we should all be more aware of. It’s shined a light on the importance of password complexity and being aware of who we’re really talking to online.

Cybercrime is rampant and shows no sign of slowing down, so it’s eye-opening to see it impact people around me. Please use a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to secure your online accounts from scammers, and never reuse passwords. The internet is a wonderful tool, it opens us up to unlimited possibilities, but it does the same for criminals.
