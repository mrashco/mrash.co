Hello friend,

How has your week been? Reply amd tell me.

My week feels long. Not sure why. It’s been full of family gatherings and time spent with those closest. I hope it’s been the same for you. This issue is focused on looking inward. I’ve found the more we discover ourselves, the better we can contribute to others.

## 1. Sit Down and Think
We get bombarded with notifications. Social media and our devices stop us from being intentional. Our attention is a valuable resource we often waste.

“Modern humans spend virtually no time on inward-directed thought.” Stop wasting your attention. Start looking inward at what’s most important. Let’s be more intentional with our actions.

> “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone” from Oliver Burkeman.

## 2. Friendship Framework
How many friends do you have? How close are your friends? Are all your friends at the same level? What makes someone a friend?

What if we had a clear framework to think about this? A levelling system we could use for all friends.

- Level D: Friendly, those we know and like
- Level C: Friends, ones we care about and enjoy their time
- Level B: Supportive Friends from our tribe/circle/network
- Level A: Emotional Friends, we’re safe to be our “lesser self”

Derek Sivers used a throwaway term “level C, not level A friend” during an interview. Which sparked the idea I’m affectionately naming the Friendship Framework.

## Thank You For Reading

**This week I’ve been grateful for growth**

I’ve had the wrong view of growth, I’d get embarrassed when doing something wrong. That turned into negativity which stopped me from growing. What a waste of time!

When I started to write, I realised my thinking was all wrong. Failing is an opportunity to learn. I’ve been daily journaling on and off since May of this year, 2020. That’s only a few months of writing. I feel I’ve learnt so much in that short time.

**What I’ve been up to**

I wrote 6 Reasons You Need A Weekly Newsletter. The benefits of writing a weekly newsletter. I also had small recognition from an inspirational figure Guy Raz!
