Hey friend,

September's come and gone! This month's felt long as term 3 wrapped up, lots has happened and now it's the last term for 2021. Let's look over some highlights for the month. 

*Disclaimer, you're receiving this newsletter as you subscribed to or downloaded from [mrash.co](http://mrash.co). If you'd like to unsubscribe, see below, also, here's [last month's newsletter](https://mrashleyball.com/letter/buckets-august-2021/).*

## Why I Do... What I Do

If you didn't know, I'm an I.T. Teacher at a local institute in Australia.

I love my job! The lifestyle, the team, the students, it's all good, mostly.

This term **I helped a student get hired at a local software dev company.** I'm so proud of them!

The business that hired my student reached out to me, I explained the details to the class and shared my thoughts for applying. I essentially summarised this [article](https://mrashleyball.com/a-students-guide-to-working-in-2021/) on students finding work.

Also, **another one of my** **classes finished after 2 years**. It's the longest time I've had with students, there's a certain bond you form as a teacher. It was sad to see them go and I wish them the very best in their future.

Since the term finished, **we had a small break as it overlapped with our second wedding anniversary.** We escaped to a small coastal town for a nice getaway. Holidaying 30 minutes away from home is our new favourite thing.

## 'What a Pearl'

Since [June](https://mrashleyball.com/letter/may-july-21-16/), I started [passive investing](https://mrashleyball.com/beginners-guide-to-investment-income-tax-super-stocks/) via Vanguard, now **I'm switching brokers to [Pearler](https://go.mrash.co/pearler),** see [Vanguard vs Pearler](https://mrashleyball.com/vanguard-vs-pearler-best-aussie-fire-broker/)**.** Nothing's changed in my strategy.

I noticed Pearler from FIRE content creators. Pearler aligns with my investing style, save and store money in low-risk containers like ETFs.

Speaking of shiny pearls, **I've been distracted by an opportunity in the form of website investing.** Basically, buy, renovate and sell websites for profit. It's a digital version of property investing. Have you ever heard of or done this? Would love to hear from you.

If you'd like to start investing, see [my guide](https://mrashleyball.com/beginners-guide-to-investment-income-tax-super-stocks/) and consider signing up to [Pearler](https://go.mrash.co/pearler). We'll both get a free trade worth $9.50AUD, so that's cool.

## Keep'n It Co

Let's talk consistency. I have a long list of things I struggle with and consistency is up there.

Since [April](https://mrashleyball.com/letter/its-me-again/), I've learnt a lot through my [#100DaysOfHacking](https://mrashleyball.com/100daysofhacking/) journey. However, **I've put [Cyber Sec](https://mrashleyball.com/starting-out-in-cyber-security/) on hold to focus on work and to have a break.** I'll be back on the hacking saddle soon.

In an effort to be consistent with content creation and blogging, here are [my website's monthly stats via Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/s/vnY0yVATVa4). I've noticed since making a few changes to the backend Google Analytics is not recording user data, not sure what's going on there.

It's great to see [mrash.co](http://mrash.co) slowly grow with every new blog post. Speaking of which, for this month I've posted two new articles, 1) [Guide To SEO](https://mrashleyball.com/guide-to-seo-ultimate-beginners-guide-for-seo/), and 2) [Optimising WordPress](https://mrashleyball.com/optimize-wordpress-speed-how-to-load-wordpress-fast/), and 3) [Vanguard Vs Pearler](https://mrashleyball.com/vanguard-vs-pearler-best-aussie-fire-broker/).

Next month I'll be going over my dreams, yep, my long term goals. This is all an effort to keep consistent.

Thanks for reading,
