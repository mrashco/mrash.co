Hello friend,

Annnnnd the aware for the longest break of a weekly newsletter goes too… me.

Yes, it’s been a while, but I hope you’ve been well. Let’s go!

## NetworkChuck’s Been On My Website!
NetworkChuck recent [https://youtu.be/gwUz3E9AW0w](you need a website) video has my website in the description! So cool!

Like he says, “Why don’t you have a website? I think EVERYONE needs a website, especially if you are trying to get a job in information technology!!”

I’m a big fan of creating your own corner on the internet, it leads to amazing things, LIKE THIS!

Hacking involves learning the in’s and out’s of the computer and then seeing how you can have fun with it! It’s like a game with rules, levels and goals.

Here are the days (so far).

## Investing In 2021
So, this is new territory, but I’m researching investing.

I’m currently writing a post about my money, future wealth plans and investment goals. I’d like to invest in the stock market over the next 5 years, woohoo! These topics are not common in my circles, so excited to explore them more.

If you have any resources of assistance, I’d love to hear from you!

As a thank you, I’d like to share a letter to procrastination with you. It’s unpublished and was intended to go live a month or so ago.

Thank you for your support.
