Hi friend,

I hope your November has been well, question, do you write a lot? Generally, most people write or type daily as it's fundamental to their job or life. It's also the basis of how computer programs are made so it's sort of what the entire tech world is built on. Writing is how we share information, how we teach and provide knowledge. Let's see how writing independently can improve our lives.

*Disclaimer, you’ve received this [newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) as you’ve subscribed to [MrAsh.co](https://mrashleyball.com/) (or downloaded a freebie), if interested, read [last month’s](https://mrashleyball.com/letter/oct-21/).*

## Writing, Independently

Look, I'm a bit biased, I love writing! This newsletter and the blog posts make up most of my website, it's fair to say writing is a hobby of mine. I've found having my own website to write and share my thoughts helps me a lot. 

I believe everyone should learn to write well, I think it's vital to our mental health and for humanity as a whole, big claims I know. If you want to start writing in the form of a blog, which I highly recommend, I put a post together called the [Guide to SEO](https://mrashleyball.com/guide-to-seo-ultimate-beginners-guide-for-seo/) which may help you!

If interested, the best place to learn to write comes from [Julian Shapiro's Writing Well Guide](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro). Julian will take you through ideas, drafting rewriting and much more! It's an amazing free resource to get your creative juices flowing!
