Yo, let's get started with Kali Linux.

We'll set up a virtual machine with Kali Linux and VirtualBox.

## Download VirtualBox 

First things first, head over to https://www.virtualbox.org/ and download the latest version of VirtualBox. Make sure to choose the correct version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc.).

Next, we need Kali Linux itself. Visit https://www.kali.org/get-kali/ and navigate to the "get-kali" section. Here, you'll find pre-made virtual machines for various architectures (32-bit or 64-bit). Choose the one that matches your system (most likely 64-bit these days).

## Downloading the Virtual Machine:

Click on "VirtualBox" under the pre-built VM section.
The file size is around 3 GB, so be prepared for a bit of a wait depending on your internet speed.
In the rare case of a virus detection, you can safely ignore it as we're downloading from a trusted source.

## Setting Up the Virtual Machine:

We'll cover the VirtualBox setup process in the next video. But for now, I hope this gets you started on downloading the necessary files!

Just a heads-up:

The antivirus might flag the Kali Linux download as a Trojan. This is a false positive since Trojans are part of the tools included in Kali Linux.
We trust the source (Kali Linux website) and can safely allow the download.

Check out the video of a walkthrough of the Kali Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox!
