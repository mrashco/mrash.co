Welcome to the blog.

Let's get you started with Kali Linux.

We'll download VirtualBox which runs virtual machines (VM).

Then we'll get Kali Linux, and setup the VM.

## Download VirtualBox 

Head to [VirtualBox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to download the latest version of VirtualBox. 

Get the right version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

## Download Kali Linux

Next, get Kali Linux itself. 

Visit [get-kali](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) to find a pre-made VM.

Check the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). 

Choose the one that matches your system (most likely 64-bit these days).

Click on "VirtualBox" under the pre-built VM section.

The file size is ~3GB, so be prepared for a bit of a wait depending on your internet speed.

In the rare case of a virus detection, you can safely ignore it as we're downloading from a trusted source.

We'll cover the VirtualBox setup process in the next video. But for now, I hope this gets you started on downloading the necessary files!

Just a heads-up:

The antivirus might flag the Kali Linux download as a Trojan. 

This is a false positive since Trojans are part of the tools included in Kali Linux.
We trust the source (Kali Linux website) and can safely allow the download.

## Setup Kali Linux VM

Check out the video of a walkthrough of the Kali Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox!
